Bush (SIGNED EDITION)</h2><p>Some shelf wear</p><p></p><h2>The Arte of Limning: A More Compendious Discourse Concerning Ye Art of Liming (Fyfield Books)</h2><p>A dual text edition of this work that sets Hilliard&#39;s text opposite a modern day translation.</p><p>Nicholas Hilliard (1546-1618), the first major painter whose name we know, painted the minature portraits from which we recognise many of the people of the court of Elizabeth I. His technique &#39;limning&#39; which utilised water-based pigments, was considered among the highest pictorial arts.</p><h2>Words for Silence: A Year of Contemplative Meditations</h2><p>Encourages believers to live as deeply as possible into the desire for union with God, offering meditations that deal with practical issues, guideposts for spiritual discernment, and lyrical evocations.</p><p>Before author Fruehwirth became Guardian (head) of the Order of Julian of Norwich, an order of Anglican contemplatives, he was the groundskeeper. Rather like Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, whom he cites approvingly, Fruehwirth brings a humble sense of the ordinariness of life to this series of "chapter talks"-addresses to his community providing spiritual formation. Organized around the liturgical year, these short reflections examine and promote contemplation. Fruehwirth is thoughtful, practical and poetic. Living in intimacy with God, the goal of the contemplative, requires building good inner habits of awareness and surrender to God's service. Small things can help: "no leaning, no slouching" is a posture of awareness, like the erect posture of one seated in meditation. Fruehwirth is also insightful: Lenten reflections on the deadly sins unite psychology and theology in thought-provoking ways. His work also calls attention to the relatively underappreciated legacy of his order's founder, the 14th-century English mystic Julian. This little, lovely book should be read slowly and savored as a guide to the inner landscape of contemplation. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Inspsired by the legends, superstitions, and fairy tales of Lagerl�f's native V�rmland region, <i>G�sta Berling's Saga</i> features a vivid cast of characters. The eponymous hero, a country pastor whose appetite for alcohol and indiscretions ends his ministerial career, falls in with a dozen vagrant Swedish cavaliers and enters into a power struggle with the richest woman in the province.

Blake devised an etching process for his pages of hand-lettered poems; but Patchen works more freely with watercolor, casein, inks, and other media, as he blends word and image in intricate but always visually compelling patterns of shape, color, and meaning. The fusion of two arts in Hallelujah Anyway gives us an intensification and an enlargement of the poetic process - an extra dimension - not in the limited sense of an &#34;illustrated&#34; poem (Patchen does not write a poem and then simply draw a picture to go with it), but as a new kind of simultaneous creativity.</p><p></p><h2>Chronicle in Stone</h2><p>Chronicle in Stone...is epic in its simplicity; the history of a young Albanian and a primitive Albania awakening into the modern world.&#x2014;Michael Dregni, Minneapolis Star Tribune</p><p>Ismail Kadare is Albania&#39;s best-known poet and novelist.

When she opens it up and reads aloud, the characters pop out and bring the tales to life right before the students' eyes. But Miss Smith's book isn't for everybody, and when stuffy Principal Rittenrotten has to fill in for her one morning, the dragon, princess, and knight that materialize from the pages send him from the room in a panic. The only way to make them disappear is to finish their respective stories, but Zack's classmates keep beginning new ones instead, until the school is overrun with Goldilocks, the Mad Hatter, and other such characters, seen vividly cavorting across the full-page spreads. Fortunately, Miss Smith shows up just in time and returns them to the safety of the book's pages, leaving the principal confused and her students forever in her debt. The lively, bright illustrations have a glossy, computer-generated quality that young readers will appreciate. Miss Smith wears a black leather jacket and a lapel button advertising "The Clash," and has a punk-rock hairdo.

Visit his website at davisbunn.com.<p><strong>Chapter One</strong> </p> <p> Brian Blackstone gripped the banister and eased him self down the left-hand set of stairs. The steps' creaking bounced back and forth through the vast formal hall. This one room, the entrance hall to what had once been a splendid English manor, was half the size of his former house. The railing shook and rattled beneath his hands like ill-fitting dentures. But his weakened state forced him to lean heavily on the banister. Each step groaned as if it was ready to break and pitch him headlong. When he reached the stone landing, he heaved a sigh of relief. He heard sounds emanating from the downstairs apartment and hurried for the front door. He needed to meet whoever shared this house, but not now. One thing at a time. It was a creed that had served him well for the past two years. </p> <p> Outside the solid-oak door, Brian almost stumbled over his valises. The leather suitcases were battered and grimy from two hard years of third-class travel. He had left them there the previous night because he had not felt able to carry them up the winding stairs. And the taxi driver who had brought him in from London's Heathrow Airport had certainly not been willing to take them anywhere, not after he had seen the paltry tip Brian had offered. Brian really was in no shape financially to take a taxi at all. But so late at night there had been no other way to journey from the airport to the village of Knightsbridge. </p> <p> Brian heaved one case and then the other into the foyer. He unlatched the clasps and dragged out two cotton sweaters and his only jacket. They were the warmest things he owned. The clothes felt distinctly odd, particularly when layered one on top of the other. It was the first time in eleven months he had worn more than sandals, shorts, and a thin cotton shirt. </p> <p> The December wind made up in wet chill for what it lacked in strength. Brian walked down the graveled drive, sheltered beneath the tallest elms and chestnut trees he had ever seen. Leaves rushed about his feet as the empty branches hummed and rattled overhead. To his right stood a converted stable, red-brick and crumbling. The gatehouse and the manor's main entrance rose just beyond. The entry's tall stone pillars supported a pair of rampant lions clasping some long-forgotten family shield. The iron gates were a full fifty feet wide and thirty high, now rusted permanently open and sagging with age. </p> <p> The gatehouse was as derelict as the stables. The entire facade was covered in vines, their bases as thick as his thighs where they emerged from the earth. They framed the big lead-paned windows and the doorway. The metal plate set above the mail slot announced that the house was called Rose Cottage. </p> <p> As he passed through the main gates, he could not help but glance back. His first genuine view of the manor rising above the chestnuts was astonishing. No photograph could possibly do the estate justice, and upon his arrival the house had been reduced by the night and his fatigue to a hulking shadow. Now not even the gray wintry day could erase its decaying grandeur. The house only had three stories, but the ground and second floors were both more than twenty feet high. The Cotswold-stone manor was nine windows broad, and each window measured five feet across. </p> <p> As he walked the narrow village lane, Brian found himself thinking back to what the taxi driver had said about Knightsbridge. Strange that the man's words seemed clearer now than they had the night before, when the world had drifted vaguely through the mist of Brian's exhaustion. Now, as he walked past brick-and-flint walls bowed with the pressure of uncounted centuries, he heard the man's voice anew. The taxi driver had related how the village was the oldest borough in England. Knightsbridge had been the first capital of William the Conqueror; the ruins of his castle still stood within the village green. The present bridge was erected upon stones set in place by the Romans themselves. The village was filled with centuries of rumors about knights and clandestine monasteries and hidden secrets and mysteriously vanished treasures. On and on the taxi driver had prattled, while Brian huddled in the dark backseat and struggled not to groan. </p> <p> He felt better after a night's sleep, but slightly feverish and still very weak. The smell of freshly baked bread was the first sign that he was approaching the village's heart. The lane opened into a central square, where a banner announced the annual Christmas market. The plaza was filled with stalls and chatter and people, and flanked by buildings as old as the manor. The chilly air was spiced with mulled cider and cinnamon and cloves. Brian followed his nose to a stall with a rainbow-bright awning and a portable stove displaying trays of hot-cross buns. He pointed and asked, "How much for one of those?" </p> <p> "Fifty pence, love, and a better bargain you won't be finding here today." </p> <p> Fifty pence was eighty American cents, too much for a raisin bun as far as he was concerned. But his sense of prices had been seriously distorted by all the places he had recently left behind, and his stomach clenched with hollow hunger. It had been quite a while since he had felt much appetite for anything. "I'll take one, please." </p> <p> He stepped to the corner of the stall and stood tearing off tiny fragments of the hot bun. Experience had taught him it was far safer to take solid food in small segments. He finished the bun, wiped his sugar-coated hands on his trousers, and waited to see how his stomach responded. When all appeared calm, he returned to the stall's front. "I'll have another, please." </p> <p> "Knew you would." The woman was as broad as her stall, and the morning's heat caused her to glisten like the buns she sold. "Grand fellow like you couldn't get by on just one." </p> <p> Brian handed over his money, trying not to wince at the cost, and asked, "Could you tell me where I'd find the Whitehorse Realty Company?" </p> <p> "Just behind you, love. No, over there, by the solicitors." </p> <p> Brian thanked the woman and moved back to the side, where the booth blocked the worst of the wind. The day was probably not too cold for early December in England. He had never been in England before. In fact, he had spent two full years avoiding this very arrival. </p> <p> He felt eyes on him, and knew it was not just his imagination. He tried to remind himself that eyes had followed him through many of his travels, for he had been in a number of places where white men were an oddity. But he could not fool himself into thinking that it did not matter. Here was different. Here he was supposed to feel at home. </p> <p> A strident shouting match across the square caught his attention. He could not make out the words, but the banners above the two opposing camps were clear enough. Two elderly ladies staffed a narrow stall whose banner read, "Buy a raffle ticket and save the heritage of our village bells." Two hefty women shouted at them and gestured angrily, waving placards as though wishing they were holding battle-axes. Brian squinted and made out the placards' words: "Ban the noise; ban the bells. Sign our petition today." Just as the argument threatened to come to blows, a lean, middle-aged gentleman wearing a vicar's collar rushed up and swiftly stilled both sides. Brian found himself admiring the man and his ability to calm waters with a few quiet words. </p> <p> Then he heard two women behind him talking loudly and assuming the noise from across the market masked their voices. Brian realized they were speaking about him. </p> <p> The first woman said, "He doesn't strike me as a posh gent." </p> <p> "What, you were expecting the Yank to show up wearing a pair of shiny gray shoes, them with buttons up the side?" </p> <p> "All I'm saying is, a deep-pockets like him ought to pay a little mind to how he goes about town. Look at him, will you? Skin and bones, he is. Not to mention brown as a native. Clothes flapping on his frame like they was hanging on a line out my back garden." </p> <p> "Don't be daft. A bloke that rich can ruddy well dress how he likes." </p> <p> "Say what you like, I'm thinking the new master of Castle Keep is as batty as the old maid herself was." </p> <p> Brian finished his second hot-cross bun, brushed his hands on his trousers, and moved off. There was nothing to be gained from correcting them. Nor from asking how they knew who he was. The busybody attitude of small village life was one of the reasons he had avoided coming to Knightsbridge for so long. One of many. </p> <p> Nor were the market women the only ones who knew of him. For as he crossed the cobblestone square, the realtor's door opened and a man bounced out. Everything about him was tightly compressed. The man did not rise above five feet six inches nor weigh more than a hundred and fifty pounds. He sported a double-breasted blue blazer, a flamboyant yellow polka-dot tie and matching pocket handkerchief, and a trim beard. As he offered Brian a small, neat hand, even his smile was condensed, slipping in and out of view in seconds. His voice popped out words like a softly cracking whip. "You must be Mr. Blackstone. Hardy Seade. Such a pleasure, sir. A pleasure. Please, come in. Come in." </p> <p> The office was compact as well, the ceiling so low-beamed that Brian had to stoop to cross before the receptionist's desk. Hardy Seade asked, "Will you have a coffee, tea?" </p> <p> "Nothing, thanks." </p> <p> "Sorry about the ceiling heights. They weren't built with Americans in mind." He gave quick laugh as he led Brian into the back office. "Naturally not, since this building was erected before America was discovered. Most of the Knightsbridge market predates your aunt's estate. Have a seat there, Mr. Blackstone." </p> <p> Brian slid into the chair, eased the crick in his neck, and corrected, "My wife's aunt." </p> <p> Hardy Seade hesitated in the act of seating himself. "I beg your pardon?" </p> <p> "Heather Harding was my wife's aunt." </p> <p> Seade lowered himself and proceeded tensely.

Since 1976 she has edited October, a journal of aesthetics. Jane Livingston, former associate director and chief curator of The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., has written major books and exhibition catalogues on art and photography. Dawn Ades, Professor of Art History and Theory Essex University, Colchester, England, has written several art books, including Abbeville&#39;s The 20th-Century Poster.Andre Breton's surrealist manifestos of the 1920s and '30s, along with his novel concept of "l'amour fou," ascribed to his revolutionary Parisian art movement "the intensely illogical reality of a dream." British and American art educators Krauss, Livingston and Ades in this rich picture book examine the very extensive role of photography (an unlikely medium on the face of it) in the surrealist movement. Shown here are photographs by Man Ray, Brassai, Tabard, Ubac, Boiffard and others whose choice of subject and/or photolab manipulations leave in no doubt their surrealist competence and intent. Illogical juxtapositions, twisted imagery (e.g., Hans Bellemer's "Doll" sequence), light-and-shadow cutouts, and coldly unerotic dissections of the female form boldly assert surrealism's quest for an ultimate truthits own "psycho-atmospheric-anamorphic" knowledge.

Any kind of certainty seemed preferable to her. Now she was at least rid of that fear. There was no more uncertainty. She was in a storehouse of women, in a room where female bodies were stored for the use of men."</i><p> The use of rape as a mode of warfare was one of the atrocities that made "ethnic cleansing" such a horrifying euphemism in the '90s. The number of Muslim rape victims has been hard to establish (estimates are as high as 60,000), and the depths of the damage even more difficult to comprehend. Hidden behind the newspaper accounts--the mind-numbing policy changes, drawn and redrawn borders, and fluctuating statistics--are the stories of what happened to thousands of Muslim women and how they have since dealt with their experience. In <i>S: A Novel About the Balkans</i>, the journalist Slavenka Drakulic uses a fictional everywoman, S., to convey the complex psychological torture of the victims of large-scale, systematic rape during the Bosnian War.</p><p> Drakulic's plain, graphic prose is starkly effective; not surprisingly, her book is most powerful in the passages detailing the women's treatment by the cadres of Serbian soldiers. But S. is not just a passive victim: even in such conditions, there are moral choices that must be made and consequences to one's actions. S. discovers this through her "arrangement" with the camp commander, who chooses her for a more elaborate form of rape that involves candlelight dinners and her playing the role of a seductress. Submitting to the fantasy in order to remove herself from the gang rapes of the "women's room," S. refrains from using her new status to improve the lot of the other prisoners. The tradeoff risks the respect of her fellow victims ("You've sold yourself cheap," one of them says to her), and the future psychological cost isn't clear. When she discovers she is pregnant--the father could be any one of a hundred soldiers--she faces another set of difficult decisions. Should she bring a child born of such hate into the world? And should she tell the child about its origins? Or is she instead obliged to tell the truth about the war? "Which is the greater," she wonders, "the right to a father or the right to the truth." Though not overtly political, <i>S.</i> forces us to consider the long-term tragedy of the female victims of the Bosnian War, and is all the more valuable for its inclusion of these gray-area compromises and their painful aftereffects. <i>--John Ponyicsanyi</i></p>Slavenka Drakulic was born in Croatia in 1949.

Relating the language of totalitarian regimes to the language Newspeak in George Orwell&#39;s satirical novel &#34;1984&#34;, Young addresses the similarities and differences between the real and fictional languages, demonstrates the accuracy of Newspeak, and explores the degree of control that language can exert over the thought and behaviour of a people. Based on Orwell&#39;s own perceptions of political, literary and linguistic practices, Newspeak is used in the novel by a totalitarian dictatorship to create a distorted view of reality and to control the thought and behaviour of its subjects. It is a language in which heretical ideas cannot be expressed or even concieved. Young&#39;s analysis of the speeches and writings of actual dictators, particularly in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, reveals a similar propagandistic structure in the use, or misuse, of language, the purpose of which was to enslave and control the populace. Young&#39;s analysis of the effects of these languages on the subjects of totalitarian dictatorships reveals that although Orwell&#39;s Newspeak was a potent instrument of control over the thought and behaviour of the citizens, the language of actual totalitarian regimes was not nearly so successful. When official rhetoric and reality did not agree, the skepticism and cynicism of the people gave rise to the phenomenon of counterlanguages that attempted to reinscribe the reality of life under dictorial rule. Young evaluates the extent to which thought control succeeded under the Nazi and Soviet regimes and considers the implications that these findings offer for linguistic determinism.</p><p></p><h2>Paths of the Air (Severn House Large Print, 11)</h2><p><b><i>'the latest in the Hawkenlye series... may be Clare's best yet' - Kirkus Starred Review</i></b><br><b><i>The new novel in the popular Hawkenlye series</i></b><br><i>Autumn 1196.</i> A secretive stranger arrives at New Winnowlands, and Sir Josse dAcquin guesses that he is a returning Crusader.

Failing that, he&#x2019;d be content with returning to his beloved Hawkenlye Abbey, where he can find peace, good conversation, and a warm drink. But his boredom turns to interest when a stranger dressed in travel-stained robes appears at his door. Josse assumes the mysterious, dark-skinned man is a servant of one of the Crusaders recently returned from Outremer. The man stays a few days in Josse&#x2019;s outbuilding, then mysteriously disappears. At first offended, then puzzled, Josse determines to learn the fate of the secretive stranger.

But this is more than a guide to creating elegant dinners. It is an immensely useful and practical guide for contemporary hosts--with recipes that take a minimal amount of time and preparation. Accompanied by 100 beautiful full-color photographs, THE VILLA TABLE is a satsifying feast for the eyes as well as the appetite.</p><p>The Villa Table, the school offering classes in cookery by de' Medici at the author's Tuscany estate, now yields a cookbook. And it begins with a disclaimer. "I am not a professional cook," announces the author, who has been publishing cookbooks for the last 20 years. Hoping to reassure readers whose ways in the kitchen may be casual, she explains that she herself never had all the time in the world to spare for cookery, and that personal taste, not merely that of the experts, should be one's principle arbiter. The advice is ingratiating, though some of the recipes outstrip it in fineness of goal; a few others (e.g., spaghetti frittata) may be almost too simple. But the general standard is rich, taking in antipasti, first and second courses, vegetables, breads and sweets (an apricot caramel custard and a peach meringue are especially tempting), sauces and cheeses. The look of the book, too, is delicately ornate, with photographs that aspire to the aesthetic. It's difficult not to respond, not to glide toward the kitchen. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.De'Medici, author of several other Italian cookbooks, including The Renaissance of Italian Cooking ( LJ 12/89), also runs a cooking school called The Villa Table at her estate in Tuscany. In contrast to Renaissance , which celebrated cucina alto-borghese , the elaborate cuisine of the upper classes, this is a collection of simple, traditional, but still fresh and appealing dishes. Some are recipes the author teaches in her classes, while others are old family favorites. Most require little preparation time, and many can be made in advance. A good companion to the plethora of quick and easy "new Italian" cookbooks that have appeared in recent years; recommended for most collections.

He had no thought of publication either of his journal or his conferences&#x2015;the talks he gave to religious communities there. Although it was his nature to give his attention to what was immediately before him, he was counting the days until he would step onto the plane that would take off across the Pacific. This book contains the journal and letters Merton wrote during his Alaskan visit that were published in a limited edition in 1988 as&nbsp;<em>The Alaskan Journal</em>&nbsp;by Turkey Press. To this have been added the transcriptions of the informal but pithy talks he gave in Eagle River and Anchorage. These conferences are interesting for the direct light they throw on Merton&#x2019;s thinking about prayer, religious life and community, the priestly tradition, and they are enhanced by their spontaneous quality which gives a palpable sense of being in Merton&#x2019;s presence. Robert E. Daggy, curator of The Thomas Merton Studies Center, transcribed Merton&#x2019;s journal and letters and has contributed a fine introduction. Also included is a preface by David D. Cooper of Michigan State University and a group of some of the photographs Merton took on his Alaskan adventure.</p><p>Thomas Merton spent two weeks in Alaska in 1968 just prior to his fateful trip to the East.

What follows only gets better, deeper, more sentimental, and more bittersweet. The team, of course, is the mid-20th-century Brooklyn Dodgers, the team of Robinson and Snyder and Hodges and Reese, a team of great triumph and historical import composed of men whose fragile lives were filled with dignity and pathos. Roger Kahn, who covered that team for the New York Herald Tribune, makes understandable humans of his heroes as he chronicles the dreams and exploits of their young lives, beautifully intertwining them with his own, then recounts how so many of those sweet dreams curdled as the body of these once shining stars grew rusty with age and battered by experience. It is the rare sports book that cannot be contained by the limitations of its genre; it is equal parts journalism, memoir, social history, and poetry.Roger Kahn is the award-winning author of The Boys of Summer, the classic bestseller about Jackie Robinson, the Dodgers and growing up in Brooklyn.

It argues that it is the demands and expectations of the reader, acting alongside the creative will of the writer, that is the evolutionary motor of literary forms and genres. From man&#39;s first use of the written word simply as a form of reference, to the emergence of the first holy or devotional texts, and onto the development of fictions, both poetic and novelistic, this work aims to both challenge and enlighten.</p><p>This wide-ranging and erudite exploration of the topic of reading is suffused with the spirit of Manguel&#39;s fellow Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges. Manguel takes us through the history of reading as if leading us room by room through the infinite library Borges constructed in one of his famous stories. Manguel&#39;s approach is not chronological, but thematic. His chapter topics jump from attempts to censor reading to the physical surroundings favored by readers, from the limitations of translations to the esotericism of books written for a restricted readership. Throughout he moves easily through time and geography to quote anecdotes and examples from diverse sources. Manguel&#39;s enthusiasm, and the impressive breadth of his reading, will make his readers eager to rush to the nearest library.Alberto Manguel is a writer, translator, and editor of international reputation; his many books include The Dictionary of Imaginary Places (with Gianni Guadalupi), the award-winning novel News From a Foreign Country Came, and the short story anthologies Black Water, The Gates of Paradise, and (with Craig Stephenson) In Another Part of the Forest.

From Jack the Ripper to Sacco and Vanzetti, here is a masterpiece of detective work in its own right.</p><p>Whether you agree or not that Sherlock Holmes was the greatest detective who never lived, there is little evidence here that his maker, Conan Doyle, could have been admitted to the first rank of investigators--unless enthusiasm for the grisly be the prime qualification. In a rehash of cases that interested Conan Doyle enough to publicly comment on, Costello (Jules Verne, 1978, etc.) begins with Conan Doyle's childhood enthusiasm for Madame Tussaud's (``I am delighted with the room of Horrors and with the images of the murderers''); documents his subject's membership in the secretive Crimes Club, a discussion group that concentrated on the infamous, such as Jack the Ripper (Conan Doyle felt more should have been done with the Ripper's handwriting samples); follows Conan Doyle from England to America to South Africa to Australia, and recaps the mysteries he came in contact with in each. Costello recounts Conan Doyle's appearance at the Crippen trial; his Scotland Yard communication over the ``Brides in the Bath'' murders; his incontrovertible proof that George Edalji was innocent (although the Home Office didn't seem to care); his pesky snooping into the Agatha Christie disappearance (Conan Doyle, out of deference to a fellow author, knew more than he told about her motive); and his opinion of Sacco and Vanzetti (``the two Italians were executed not as murderers but as anarchists''). Costello cites a dozen or more cases, some seeming to reflect his own interest more than Conan Doyle's, then ventures into dicey territory: Conan Doyle's spiritualism and his trust in clues/solutions rendered by various prominent mediums. An incorrigible tendency toward abbreviating Conan Doyle's views to promulgate his own diminishes Costello's well-researched quasi-biography, which ultimately makes the crimes more interesting than the crimewriter.

Born in 1918, L'Engle grew up in New York City, Switzerland, South Carolina and Massachusetts. Her father was a reporter and her mother had studied to be a pianist, and their house was always full of musicians and theater people. L'Engle graduated cum laude from Smith College, then returned to New York to work in the theater. While touring with a play, she wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain</i>, originally published in 1945. She met her future husband, Hugh Franklin, when they both appeared in <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. Upon becoming Mrs. Franklin, L'Engle gave up the stage in favor of the typewriter. In the years her three children were growing up, she wrote four more novels. Hugh Franklin temporarily retired from the theater, and the family moved to western Connecticut and for ten years ran a general store. Her book <i>Meet the Austins</i>, an American Library Association Notable Children's Book of 1960, was based on this experience. Her science fantasy classic <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was awarded the 1963 Newbery Medal. Two companion novels, <i>A Wind in the Door</i> and <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i> (a Newbery Honor book), complete what has come to be known as The Time Trilogy, a series that continues to grow in popularity with a new generation of readers. Her 1980 book <i>A Ring of Endless Light</i> won the Newbery Honor.

Ludecus recounts in his letters the colonists' efforts to provide protection from Indian attacks by constructing around the settlement a high, thorny barrier of mesquite branches and cactus cleared from the land they wished to plant. He narrates how the carpenters among the colonists fashioned a cannon of oak which they successfully fired once to warn off hostile Indians in the area.<br><br>His record of life in the colony emphasizes the deprivation suffered by the colonists. From the day of their arrival at the colony site to the day most of the colonists abandoned the settlement in desperation, Ludecus's letters are filled with descriptions of the colonists' hardships and frustration as they tried to cope with an almost total lack of stone and timber in the vicinity of Dolores for constructing houses, outbuildings, and fencing around their young crops.<br><br>Eduard Ludecus's letters are also a source of valuable information about life and culture in pre-revolutionary Texas. His letters are one of just a handful of eyewitness reports about the early Texas frontier. His observations are those of a young, well-educated German merchant who had traveled from the urbane environment of Weimar, the center of art and literature in Germany in the early nineteenth century, to the raw, hostile environment of Texas. As a result, many of his remarks seem to have been recorded in wide-eyed awe of his new environment.<br><br>Ludecus's letters are written with a vivid directness often lacking in the recollections of such well-known narrators as John C. Duval, Noah Smithwick, and John Holland Jenkins. Ludecus's narrative style is so vivid, so lively that the reader often feels as if he were sharing the narrator's experiences and observations not as a reader, but as a companion.<br><br></p><p>LOUIS E.

Comparable in some ways to photojournalism, reportage illustrators are acting as visual journalists, proactively creating narrative work about issues and subjects, translating what they witness into handmade imagery. There is evidence that illustrations connect to people in powerful ways whether they are drawings created while embedded with troops in Afghanistan, documenting during a courtroom trial or recreating the energy of the crowd at a rock concert. This area of applied illustration also provides career opportunities for students and takes them out of the classroom and into different environments and situations. With practical information about tools, techniques and coping in various situations as well as inspirational interviews and advice from reportage artists working in the field, this book will fill a gap in this growing market.</p><p><p><b>Gary Embury</b> is a senior lecturer at the University of the West of England, Bristol and an illustrator with over 20 years of experience.

Specters has reasonably interesting characters (Dillard's strong suit), but the plot is so predictable that however much one likes and admires the tale's victims, it is impossible to work up much sympathy (or shock) when they are shot, stabbed, drugged or beaten. The story involves a serial killer, Rolf Brunerp. 211 , whose murder of his lover leaves an indelible impression on the dead woman's five-year-old twin daughters, Avra and Magdalen. As for Rolf, he has a thing for young girls (his being caught with Avra was the occasion of the fight leading to their mother's death), and when the twins cross his path again 25 years later, the past comes terrifyingly alive. Dillard plays around with point of view by presenting events from the perspective of both victim and perpetrator, and by jumping back and forth between the present and Bruner's childhood. But there is nothing here to snag and sustain a reader's attention: neither the visceral thrill of a good work of horror, nor the human interest of plausible, complex characters. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dixie Cragger&#39;s Atlas Climber&#39;s Guide to Alabama and Georgia.</h2><p>Comprehensive guide to rock climbing in Tenneessee, Alabama, and Georgia</p><p></p><h2>Sacred Landscape: The Buried History of the Holy Land since 1948</h2><p>As a young man Meron Benvenisti often accompanied his father, a distinguished geographer, when the elder Benvenisti traveled through the Holy Land charting a Hebrew map that would rename Palestinian sites and villages with names linked to Israel's ancestral homeland. These experiences in Benvenisti's youth are central to this book, and the story that he tells helps explain how during this century an Arab landscape, physical and human, was transformed into an Israeli, Jewish state.<br><br>Benvenisti first discusses the process by which new Hebrew nomenclature replaced the Arabic names of more than 9,000 natural features, villages, and ruins in Eretz Israel/Palestine (his name for the Holy Land, thereby defining it as a land of Jews <i>and</i> Arabs). He then explains how the Arab landscape has been transformed through war, destruction, and expulsion into a flourishing Jewish homeland accommodating millions of immigrants. The resulting encounters between two peoples who claim the same land have raised great moral and political dilemmas, which Benvenisti presents with candor and impartiality.<br><br>Benvenisti points out that five hundred years after the Moors left Spain there are sufficient landmarks remaining to preserve the outlines of Muslim Spain. Even with sustained modern development, the ancient scale is still visible. Yet a Palestinian returning to his ancestral landscape after only fifty years would have difficulty identifying his home. Furthermore, Benvenisti says, the transformation of Arab cultural assets into Jewish holy sites has engendered a struggle over the "signposts of memory" essential to both peoples.<br><br><i>Sacred Landscape</i> raises troublesome questions that most writers on the Middle East avoid. The now-buried Palestinian landscape remains a symbol and a battle standard for Palestinians and Israelis. But it is Benvenisti's continuing belief that Eretz Israel/Palestine has enough historical and physical space for the people of both nations and that it can one day be a shared homeland.</p><p>"It has been Benvenisti's fate and gift to know the conflicting maps of both Israelis and Palestinians.

In this award-winning book, Maxwell asserts that you don't have to be the main leader to make significant impact in your organization. Good leaders are not only capable of leading their followers but are also adept at leading their superiors and their peers. Debunking myths and shedding light on the challenges, John Maxwell offers specific principles for Leading Down, Leading Up, and Leading Across. 360-Degree Leaders can lead effectively, regardless of their position in an organization. By applying Maxwell's principles, you will expand your influence and ultimately be a more valuable team member.</p><p><b>John C. Maxwell</b> is an internationally recognized leadership expert, speaker, and author who has sold over 13 million books. His organizations have trained more than 2 million leaders worldwide. Dr. Maxwell is the founder of EQUIP and INJOY Stewardship Services.In this latest treatise, leadership mega-guru Maxwell (<i>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</i>) taps a rich vein of corporate angst: the plight of the middle manager, saddled with responsibilities but lacking real power, torn by conflicting tasks and time-management dilemmas, seething with thwarted ambition. As Macbeth shows, it's a predicament fraught with tragic potential, but the staid, platitudinous treatment given it by Maxwell and ghostwriter Charlie Wetzel drains away the drama. They generally counsel acceptance of limitations. Maxwell tells middle managers to work diligently in subordinate positions, support the CEO's vision, find the good in incompetent or malevolent leaders, infiltrate their bosses' emotional lives ("Listen to your leader's heartbeat.... What makes them laugh?... Cry?.... Sing?") and "stand up for your leader whenever you can." They can thus exert an unsung but crucial "influence" over higherups, while themselves practicing a higher, sublimated form of leadership by selflessly nurturing the potential of their own colleagues and underlings. Unfortunately, Maxwell's practical advice boils down to vague truisms ("when you find a problem, provide a solution") or clich�s ("If your boss is a golfer, you may want to take up the game"). His bland injunctions to resignation, patience and self-effacement are unobjectionable, but also uninspiring. <i>(Jan. 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With over 35 seasonal projects using fat quarters, charm squares, and other fabric pre-cuts, there's a project for every occasion. Let the celebrating begin!<br> (<i>McCall's Quick Quilts, Feb/Mar 2013</i>)<br><br>No&#x2014;this is not a cook book, it's a book of quilting and sewing projects. If you're not familiar with the terminology that fabric manufacturer, Moda, uses, you're forgiven for feeling confused. Moda has spearheaded the marketing of a range of pre-cut fabrics in recent years, many of which are referred to with food names, such as jelly rolls (2 1/2 x 42 in strips), layer cakes (10 in squares) and honey buns (1 1/2 x 42 in strips). In keeping with the theme, they've taken to referring to quilt project instructions as recipes, quilt designers as chefs and materials lists as ingredients. This book is a collection of 30 projects all made using pre-cuts. They range from table mats, bags, wallhangings and wreaths up to bed quilts. It's a very rich resource to have on your bookshelf - there's something here for almost every occasion when you might want to present a special someone with a homemade gift, and the use of pre-cuts streamlines the process. Of course, you don't need to use pre-cuts&#x2014;there's nothing stopping you from buying yardage or raiding your stash and cutting the fabric yourself. The instructions are detailed, and there is a good, clear photograph of every finished project and diagrams to illustrate steps along the way. (<i>Australian Homespun Magazine, March 2013</i>)<br><br>To celebrate the availability of pre-cut fabrics, this book, with more than 35 projects to sew using Jelly Rolls, Layer Cakes, Fat Quarters and Charm Squares, will afford you dozens of bright projects, which are so much quicker to make using the pre-cut fabrics. The projects are divided into seasonal themes, which are predominantly American, but many can be adapted for celebrations in the UK.

He studied in London and Bradford, gaining degrees in pharmacy and computer science, and has worked in a variety of jobs, including pharmacist, technical author, software engineer, and freelance journalist.In the preamble to his latest far-reaching novel, Stross invokes Asimov&#x2019;s famous three laws of robotics, including the one that says robots are forbidden to harm their human masters. The problem here is that there are no more humans left to harm; they became extinct sometime in the twenty-third century. Hundreds of years on, the civilization that spans the solar system and beyond consists entirely of sophisticated androids, one of whom (the narrator) is struggling to make ends meet. With her usual patrons long dead, femmebot Freya Nakamichi must pick up work wherever she finds it. When a run-in with a vengeful android aristocrat forces her to flee a Venus resort, she grabs the first gig available: ferrying a mysterious package between Mercury and Mars. Unfortunately, many dangerous and powerful androids are also eager to pilfer the package, and the price of securing it may be Freya&#x2019;s own identity. Stross takes a plot device common to mystery novels and turns it into one of the most stylishly imaginative robot tales ever penned. --Carl Hays</p><h2>90-Minute Quilts: 15+ Projects You Can Stitch in an Afternoon</h2><p><p>You can never have too many timesaving techniques when it comes to quilting!

Chen style is best known for its emphasis on &#34;twining energy&#34; and this book lays down a foundation for developing internal energy by paying attention to the details of each movement. This approach makes this book of interest to anyone serious about developing their own Taijiquan practice to truly become an &#34;internal&#34; martial artist. It begins by explaining the Ten Elements of Taijiquan and the Thirteen Elements of Chen Style Taijiquan. All movements are broken down into detail, individually for each part of the body. This so that the reader fully understands the meaning of the old Taiji dictum: &#34;When one part of the body moves, everything moves.&#34; Complex stances and movements are explained with annotated figures. This book presents in great detail the full Chen Style Small Frame method with its First Routine. Becoming vastly popular in China and abroad, excerpts are given by Chen Li-Qing, the first woman to be listed in the Chen family lineage. Chapter 4 includes a section by Master Chen, including her advice on the role of perseverance in one&#39;s practice: &#34;Thick ice does not come from one day&#39;s cold.&#34;</p><p>Fan Chun-Lei, a Full Professor of Cellular Biology at Zhejiang Chinese Medical University in Hangzhou, China, has been a disciple of Master Chen Li-Qing since 1986. He is the author of two Chen Taiji books in Chinese: Small Frame First Routine and History: a Detailed Explanation of Chen Family Taijiquan (Zhongguo Taiji Ming Quan - Chen Shi Taijiquan Xiangjie) and Chen Family Taijiquan: First Routine and Second Routine (Zhongguo Taiji Ming Quan - Chen Shi Xiaojia Taijiquan). Fan Chun-Lei was Chen-Style Taijiquan Champion at the 9th games of Zhejiang Province in China. He teaches Chen-Style Taijiquan and Qigong to both Chinese students and visiting groups from overseas including English-speaking delegations. He has specialized training in both Mind-leading Static Qigong and Spontaneous Qigong. Frank Shiery, who has been studying Chen Taijiquan for over 20 years, was formally recognized as a disciple of Master Chen Li-Qing in 1994. He and co-author Fan Chun-Lei have been close friends and &#34;Kung-Fu brothers&#34; since 1993. He travels regularly to China to hone his skills with Master Chen as well as being tutored by other Chen masters including Chen Yong-Fu, Chen Zheng-Lei, and Chen Chuan-Sheng. Frank Shiery teaches traditional Chen Taijiquan and Taiji weapons at his martial arts school, the Pennsylvania Chen Taijiquan Association, in Philadelphia, PA, U.S.A. Frank is the president of the Philadelphia Area Taijiquan Association. He also leads Taijiquan training tours to China to provide overseas students the opportunity to be tutored in-person by the Chen family masters. www.PaChenTaiji.com</p><h2>My Uncle Martin&#39;s Big Heart</h2><p>In this inspiring story about Martin Luther King Jr.&#x2014;told from the perspective of his young niece&#x2014;readers will gain personal insight into one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century.

Actually, it was Uncle M.L.&#x201d; Watkins briefly mentions some of the famous events associated with King during the civil-rights era, such as protest marches and speeches, but the focus is on the special relationship the child shared with a favorite uncle and the details she remembers, such as his humor and laughter.

Combine this memoir with Christine King Farris's My Brother Martin (S &amp; S, 2003) and March on! The Day My Brother Martin Changed The World (Scholastic, 2008).

One can swallow the sea; one has an iron neck; one can stretch his legs; one can survive fire; and the last can hold his breath forever. When one of the brothers, a somehow very successful fisherman, agrees to let a young boy accompany him on his fishing trip, trouble results. This brother holds the entire sea in his mouth so that the boy can retrieve fish and treasures. When the man can no longer hold in the sea, he frantically signals to the boy, but the boy ignores him and drowns when the man releases the water. The man is accused of murder and sentenced to death. However, one by one, his four brothers assume his place when subjected to execution, and each uses his own superhuman ability to survive. At the end of the story, a judge decides that the brother accused of murder must have been innocent, since he could not be executed, and the five brothers return home.</p><p></p><h2>Power Systems : Analysis and Design</h2><p>Based on William Stevenson&#39;s classic, &#34;Elements of Power System Analysis&#34;, this new senior/graduate text offers a completely modern update of this popular textbook. Covering such topics as power flow, power-system stability and transmission lines, the book teaches the fundamental topics of power system analysis accompanied by logical discussions and numerous examples.</p><p>When John Grainger began revising William Stevenson&#39;s classic Elements of Power System Analysis, he realized that a complete modernization was in order. By the time he finished, an entirely new book was written, re-titled Power System Analysis. Covering such topics as power flow, power system stability and transmission lines, Power System Analysis teaches the fundamental topics of power system analysis using logical discussions and numerous examples. The new chapter on power system state estimation incorporates the latest developments in the field, and the discussion of system control covers economic factors of line losses and penalty factors. The loyal following earned by Stevenson will surely enjoy the modern power system analysis presented here.JOHN D GRAINGER is a former teacher turned professional historian. He has over thirty books to his name, divided between classical history and modern British political and military history.

He once said, &#34;God created paper for the purpose of drawing architecture on it. Everything else is at least for me an abuse of paper.&#34; In the U.S. Aalto&#39;s critical reception began with his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 World Fair in New York: Frank Lloyd Wright described it as a &#34;work of genius.&#34; After World War II, Aalto also designed MIT&#39;s student dormitory. Prior to this, the architect&#39;s Paimio Sanatorium (1929) and Viipuri Library (1935), both in Finland, had already attracted international praise. He was also an outstanding town planner, painter and sculptor. Aalto&#39;s Modernism entailed the use of natural materials, warm colors, and undulating lines, and he is considered an important early exponent of Organic Design as a result. Of his design work outside of architecture, Aalto&#39;s vases, lamps, glassware and laminated bent-plywood furniture (pioneered and produced through the design company he co-founded, Artek) are equally esteemed. Iconic pieces include the Savoy Vase, the Paimio Chair and the Beehive Lamp. This monograph on Aalto&#39;s highly collectible furniture designs expands our understanding of the diverse abilities of this influential architect/designer.</p><p></p><h2>Ethics in the Community of Promise: Faith, Formation, and Decision, Second Edition</h2><p>In this excellent and accessible introduction, now in a second edition, Childs helpfully articulates the shared features of Christian faith and shows how that communal commitment forms our values, character, virtues, and &#34;eagerness to do what is right.&#34; Who we are informs what we choose. This dynamic, dialogical basis for ethics is an open framework. Childs applies it to a host of tough, real-life dilemmas such as affirmative action, end-of-life decisions, medical ethics, truth telling, environmental justice, and war-making. Previously published by Fortress Press in 1992 as Faith, Formation, and Decision, the new edition updates discussions throughout, adds numerous cases and illustrations, adds questions for discussion and items for further reading, and contains a new section on courage.</p><p>James M. Childs, Jr. is the Sittler Professor of Christian Ethics at Trinity Lutheran Seminary in Columbus, Ohio.

The pieces collected here explore a variety of issues facing the American West&#x2014;disappearing Native American languages, deteriorating air quality, suburban sprawl, species loss, grassland degradation, and many others&#x2014;and suggest steps toward &#x201c;healing.&#x201d; More than &#x201c;dealing with&#x201d; or &#x201c;solving,&#x201d; according to the editors, healing addresses not just symptoms but their underlying causes, offering not just a temporary cure but a permanent one.<br><br>The signs of illness and trauma can seem omnipresent in today&#x2019;s West: land and soil disrupted from mining, overgrazing, logging, and farming; wildlife habitat reduced and fragmented; native societies disturbed and threatened; open space diminished by cities and suburbs; wilderness destroyed by roads and recreation-seekers. But as these essays suggest, the &#x201c;treatment program&#x201d; for healing the West has many healthful side effects. Engaging in the kinds of projects suggested by contributors is therapeutic not only for the environment but for participants as well. Restoration, repair, and recovery can counter symptoms of despair with concentrated doses of promise and possibility.<br><br>The more &#x201c;lesions&#x201d; the West has, this book suggests, the more opportunities there are for westerners to revive and ultimately cure the ailing patient they have helped to create. The very idea of restoring the West to health, contributors and editors contend, unleashes our imaginations, sharpens our minds, and gives meaning to the ways we choose to live our lives. At the same time, acknowledging the profound difficulties of the work that lies ahead immunizes us against our own arrogance as we set about the task of healing the West.</p><p>Patricia Nelson Limerick is the faculty director and board chair of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado, where she is also a professor of history.

Written in the fifth century B.C., Sophocles&#39; tragedy concerns the shame and death of Ajax, a Greek who had won fame for his prodigious strength in the Trojan War. A brutal farewell to the valor and values of the heroic world, the play moves through a series of reversals: old allies become enemies, honor becomes disgrace, and divine power becomes temporal authority. Formally terse, this translation conveys the force and urgency of Sophocles&#39; Greek. Indeed, as Tipton suggests in his afterword, the tragedy has renewed relevance for our times: &#34;AJAX demands our attention, not only for its clear-eyed account of the bitter aftermath of victory but also for its treatment of unscrupulous politics.&#34; With a foreword by Stanley Lombardo.</p><p>Classical Greek drama is brought vividly to life in this series of new translations. Students are encouraged to engage with the text through detailed commentaries, including suggestions for discussion and analysis. In addition, numerous practical questions stimulate ideas on staging and encourage students to explore the play&#39;s dramatic qualities. Ajax is suitable for students of both Classical Civilisation and Drama. Useful features include full synopsis of the play, commentary alongside translation for easy reference and a comprehensive introduction to the Greek Theatre.

Her female contemporaries - Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone - are known to all. Now it is time for Myra Bradwell to assume her rightful place among women&#39;s rights leaders of the nineteenth century. With author Jane Friedman&#39;s discovery of previously unpublished letters and valuable documents, Bradwell&#39;s fascinating story can at last be told.</p><p><b>Jane M. Friedman </b>(d. 2016) was professor of law at Wayne State University.<br><br><b>Sara Wilmot </b>is the Myra Bradwell Award chair for the Women's Law Caucus and editor-in-chief of the <i>Gonzaga Law Review</i> at Gonzaga University. She is focused on public interest law and social advocacy.Prologue -&nbsp;"Myra Who?"<br><br>Their responses were inevitable and almost uniform. "Myra who?" queried my friends and many of my colleagues whenever I mentioned that I was writing this biography. Unfortunately, the name of Myra Bradwell is recognized by virtually no one, except for historians of women and some teachers and students of constitutional law. However, during Myra Bradwell's lifetime (1831-94), her fame was widespread. Upon her death, one legal commentator characterized her as "one of the most remarkable women of her generation and one who had no small share in making that generation what it is. "<br><br>As America's "first" woman lawyer and also as publisher and editor-in�chief of an extremely prestigious and widely circulated legal newspaper, Myra Bradwell did more to create rights for women and other legally handicapped persons than did any other woman of her day, or perhaps any day. Yet the names of many of her female contemporaries are known to all, while Myra Bradwell has, sadly, been consigned to obscurity.&nbsp;<br><br>I first learned of Myra Bradwell two decades ago. I was teaching a course in constitutional law at Wayne State University and decided to expand the unit on gender-based discrimination to include materials not then covered in the textbook. A colleague, Edward Wise, handed me the United States Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Bradwell v. Illinois</i> (1873), the case in which the Court upheld the right of the state of Illinois to exclude Bradwell from the practice of law solely because she was a woman. In a sonorous voice, I read to my class from Justice Bradley's concurring opinion:&nbsp;<br><br>"The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life. The constitution of the family organization which is founded in the <i>divine ordinances</i> as well as in the nature of things indicates the domestic sphere as that which properly belongs to the domain and functions of womanhood. The harmony, not to say identity of interests and views which belongs, or should belong, to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a distinct and independent career from that of her husband. . . . The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. <i>This is the Law of the Creator</i>."<br><br>I repeated my theatrical presentation for several years, and a good laugh was usually had by all. Eventually I began pursuing other interests and dropped the constitutional law course from my teaching curriculum. But I couldn't drop the matter of Myra Bradwell from my mind. What had become of her? Did she ever become a lawyer, or did she simply shrivel up and go back to the kitchen?&nbsp;<br><br>My initial investigation of the matter was frustrating. A check of the card catalogues at university libraries, law libraries, public libraries, and even the Library of Congress revealed nothing relating to Myra Bradwell. Biographical dictionaries yielded little that was noteworthy, except that she had been the editor of a newspaper called the <i>Chicago Legal News</i>, a fact that I glossed over much too lightly. I surmised that Justice Bradley had had the last word and that Myra Bradwell must have, in large measure, resigned herself to "fulfilling the paramount destiny and mission of woman." Believing that further pursuit of the elusive Myra Bradwell would be futile, I abandoned the project.&nbsp;<br><br>Several years later, while browsing in a law library, I stumbled upon a complete set of the bound volumes of the <i>Chicago Legal News.</i> I picked up the dusty volume, expecting to find merely synopses of court opinions and news of happenings in the Chicago legal community during the latter part of the nineteenth century. To my great surprise and pleasure, I found much more! The <i>Chicago Legal News</i> was Myra Bradwell's alter ego. In her capacity as both publisher and editor-in-chief of that weekly journal for twenty-five years, she advocated, drafted, and secured the enactment of myriad legal reforms in the areas of women's rights, child custody, improvement of the legal system, and treatment of persons alleged to be "insane." In all, she edited thirteen hundred issues of the newspaper, and each of those issues was replete with her personal opinions on countless legal and social subjects, as well as her frequent exhortations to the legislature, judiciary, governor, and members of the bar. Her influence was felt far beyond the boundaries of Illinois. Indeed, for at least two decades, the <i>Chicago Legal News</i> was the most widely circulated legal newspaper in the country. Many of Bradwell's proposals, after being enacted by the Illinois legislature, served as prototypes for legislation in other jurisdictions.&nbsp;<br><br>After reading the thirteen hundred issues of the <i>Chicago Legal News</i>, I became convinced that Myra Bradwell had to be resurrected from oblivion. I believed that, even if no other Bradwell materials existed, someone needed to tell the story of this remarkable lawyer and legal journalist who changed the course of nineteenth-century legal and social history. But I was also quite certain that there were other Bradwell documents in existence. Anyone as facile with a pen as Bradwell, I reasoned, must have corresponded with other luminaries of the day. For example, I knew (from reading the <i>Chicago Legal News</i>) that Myra was a prominent figure in the "woman suffrage" movement and was well-acquainted with Susan B. Anthony. I concluded that there must have been correspondence between them. Moreover, because the <i>Chicago Legal News</i> contained many references to Mary Todd Lincoln, I subsequently read several biographies of Mrs. Lincoln. From those, I learned that Bradwell had secured the release of Mrs. Lincoln from an insane asylum. Had the two women corresponded?&nbsp;<br><br>.............................................................<br><br>When Myra Bradwell died, her personal papers devolved to her daughter, Bessie Bradwell Helmer, a brilliant woman who had graduated as valedictorian of her class at Northwestern Law School. When Bessie died, those papers were bequeathed to Bessie's daughter, Myra Bradwell Helmer Pritchard. Unfortunately, the granddaughter had stored Myra Bradwell's papers in a manner that rendered them virtually undiscoverable....<br><br>Most were unlabeled and simply bore the return address of the Battle Creek Saddle and Hunt Club.... I unsealed the first, and out fell six letters written to Myra Bradwell by Susan B. Anthony. I opened a second, and discovered about twenty documents which, when pieced together, described the contents of the correspondence between Myra Bradwell and Mary Todd Lincoln and explained why and how Bradwell's granddaughter had sold those letters to the attorneys for the estate of Lincoln's son Robert. Those documents, together with several clippings from Chicago newspapers, also explained the ingenious strategy that Myra had employed in securing Mrs. Lincoln's release from an "insane asylum."&nbsp;<br><br>Scores of other Bradwell documents, too numerous to list, had also found their way into the sealed envelopes of the Battle Creek Saddle and Hunt Club and were almost lost to posterity.&nbsp;<br><br>My personal saga ends here, and the chronicle of Myra Bradwell's tribulations and triumphs begins.</p><h2>The Soul&#39;s Quest for God</h2><p>Through stories of Bible characters and Christian leaders, Sproul leads readers to a deeper intimacy with their Creator, emphasizing awareness of the Holy Spirit, obedience to God, and the feeding of the soul.</p><p>R.

They are of biographical and literary interest, and illuminate their close, intense, complex relationship. Nineteen of hers to him, some early versions of subsequently published poems and 12 poems never before published are also included. The letters are important for what they disclose about a major poet, but also for what they reveal about his feelings for his ambitious, disappointed, difficult mother (he called her both "Dearest" and "Jackass"), his friends and enemies, politics, religion (a Catholic, he once considered converting to Judaism), his marriages, divorces, affairs, alcoholism, mental illness and urge toward suicide. Berryman killed himself in 1972 in Minneapolis by jumping off a bridge. Kelly's editing and annotations are very fine; he is a bibliographer at the University of Minnesota.

At different times she was benefactor and adversary, encouraging his work and driving him to the brink of self-destruction. These extraordinary letters plunge the reader into his tortured private life and show such friends as Schwartz and Lowell from a new perspective. "If I had begun to adlib I'd never have stopped," he wrote of a speech. These letters are one life-long adlib chronicling his fears, longings, and successes, and stopping only at the bottom of his long slide into alcoholism, madness, and suicide.

The expressions on her victims&#x2019; faces never failed to amaze her. Waverly had flown to Los Angeles to have a two-day fling with a woman he had only recently met. He was about to commit adultery, break one of the most sacred vows, and to look at him, you&#x2019;d think he&#x2019;d just won the lottery. She doubted if he&#x2019;d been this happy on his wedding day.</p><p>Stan had always had women on the side, or so he had boasted the last time they&#x2019;d had dinner at Lorenzo&#x2019;s, a small Italian restaurant located on lower Greenville in Dallas. Since Stan was contemplating making a run for the state senate next year, he&#x2019;d been forced to curtail his extracurricular activities. Lorenzo&#x2019;s was seldom frequented by the rich and powerful, but Stan still considered it too risky. When she provided him with a seemingly foolproof solution, she had gone from sexy to downright irresistible.</p><p>The short blue dress she was wearing was one of her favorites, as it made her waist look small and accentuated her breasts. Her hair was a tousled mass of auburn curls, her lips a shimmering movie-star red. On her feet was a pair of matching blue heels. Wearing them in an airport was perilous, and for her, painful. Men loved heels, the higher the better. They didn&#x2019;t care if a woman was miserable.</p><p>Stan saw her and headed her direction, grabbing her around the waist and pulling her tight against his body. "Feel that," he said, referring to his erection. "That&#x2019;s Texas-size, sweetie pie."</p><p>She tilted her head to one side, causing the hair on the right side of her face to fall forward and obscure one eye. He was pumped up on something, probably Cialis, which was referred to as the "weekender" because it lasted several days. She doubted if he had a legitimate problem with erectile dysfunction, more a need to have a larger and longer-lasting erection. Obviously, he had wanted to impress her. How sweet, she thought facetiously. "How was your flight?"</p><p>"You look fantastic," Stan commented, stepping back so he could check out her body. "Better than I remembered, actually."</p><p>She wanted to tell him it was because he was sober. "You look great, too, baby." She clapped her hands lightly like a teenager. "I&#x2019;m so excited, Stan. We&#x2019;re going to have a super time. I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re really here."</p><p>Stan noticed a middle-aged man in a brown jacket watching them. "Maybe we should get out of here," he said, placing his palm in the center of her back. "I doubt if anyone will recognize me here, but I can&#x2019;t take a chance. I do business all over the world, remember."</p><p>She gave him a wide-eyed girlish look. "I don&#x2019;t know why you want to go into politics, Stan. Being an international attorney sounds so exotic. You get to travel to all these great places. Do you go to Paris very often? I adore Paris. Rome is terrible in the summer. I visited the Tivoli Fountain in August and almost got sick. It was like a giant dust bowl full of smelly people." Men expected idiotic chatter from pretty women, so she had incorporated it into her routine.</p><p>"I don&#x2019;t have any clients in Paris," he said, disinterested. "I go to China and Japan frequently. All I do is work. Where did you park?"</p><p>"Across the street," she told him. As they headed toward the exit, she walked several feet behind him so no one would notice they were together. She had no intention of hurting his wife. Before making her final decision, she had met Belinda Waverly and even talked to several of her friends. Stan&#x2019;s wife was a beautiful, gracious woman, who seemed to do everything possible to please her husband. She ate like a squirrel, worked out every day, and was already busy organizing Stan&#x2019;s campaign. A good woman like that didn&#x2019;t deserve a man like Stan.</p><p>They were outside of the terminal, waiting for the light to change. Cabs and cars were lined up at the curb, people excitedly waiting for friends and loved ones, children jumping up and down, businessmen pacing and talking on their cell phones. Families were clustered together in colorful clothing, more than likely headed to Disneyland. Los Angeles was the best place to be in August. Even if it warmed up during the day, it always cooled down in the evenings. At present, it was midday and the temperature was in the low eighties. Compared to the triple-digit heat in Texas, Los Angeles was paradise.</p><p>"Did you check into the Hyatt like I told you?"</p><p>No one told her what to do, but he would learn that lesson later. "Hotels are so impersonal, Stan. I&#x2019;ve arranged for us to use my uncle&#x2019;s cabin."</p><p>His face muscles tensed. "We&#x2019;re staying in a damn cabin? This is L.A., for God&#x2019;s sake. How far away is this place? I&#x2019;ve been on a plane for three hours. I thought we were going to spend the next two days in the sack, not cooped up in a car."</p><p>"It&#x2019;s not far," she said with the same cheerful tone. The light changed and they crossed the street to the parking garage. "It&#x2019;s only two o&#x2019;clock, Stan. We shouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about traffic this time of day. My uncle&#x2019;s cabin overlooks a lake. We can even skinny-dip if we want. There&#x2019;s not a soul within thirty miles." He still had an annoyed look on his face. Spoiled prick, she thought, knowing he was used to getting his way. "You&#x2019;ll love it, I promise. I stocked the kitchen with food and bought us two bottles of Dom. Don&#x2019;t worry. I didn&#x2019;t forget your Jack Daniel&#x2019;s. I bought enough to fill a bathtub." She halted among the rows of cars. "Are you sure you feel comfortable about this? If you&#x2019;re not, we can call it off right now."</p><p>Stan had just been presented with the biggest decision of his life. If he displayed even a flicker of hesitance, she might reconsider killing him. But she knew he wouldn&#x2019;t. None of them did. A man never refused a piece of ass, particularly one he&#x2019;d never had before.</p><p>"Trust me," he said, smiling playfully, "I&#x2019;m not going anywhere. I&#x2019;ve been fantasizing about you for weeks." He paused, trying to remember something. "By the way, that company you turned me on to is terrific. Whoever came up with the idea is brilliant. I don&#x2019;t say this very often, but they could double their prices. I know guys who&#x2019;d pay a fortune for what this operation offers."</p><p>Tell me something I don&#x2019;t know, she thought, stopping and unlocking the door to a black Hummer. "There&#x2019;s other people out there providing these kinds of services, Stan," she told him. "You have to be extremely cautious about who you use in a delicate situation like this. You might be an attorney, but I know you&#x2019;re also a businessman. There&#x2019;s a right and a wrong way to do things. The company I referred you to doesn&#x2019;t rely on other members. Their employees seem both discreet and professional." She stopped herself. For one thing, she sounded too intelligent, and for another, Stan would be dead soon, so there was no reason to pitch him. It was as foolish as throwing bait to a fish you&#x2019;d already reeled in. Giggling, she said, "Gosh, they acted like they were the CIA or something. All this secret stuff turns me on."</p><p>He came up behind her and squeezed her breasts. "Forget the cabin," he said lustily. "Let&#x2019;s go to a damn motel."</p><p>She stepped forward and broke his grip, then hoisted herself into the driver&#x2019;s seat. "Don&#x2019;t be impatient, baby." Time for more chatter, she told herself. "Isn&#x2019;t this car fun? This is a baby Hummer, or at least that&#x2019;s what I call it. I didn&#x2019;t rent one of the big ones because I was afraid I&#x2019;d be tempted to ram something just for the hell of it." Her fingers trailed around the steering wheel. "I&#x2019;ve always wanted to drive one of these things. Besides, the road to the cabin isn&#x2019;t paved. They&#x2019;re not predicting rain or anything. I thought you&#x2019;d feel safer in this than some cheap rental." Before she started the ignition, she reached into the backseat and retrieved two bottles of strawberry-flavored water from an ice-filled cooler, wishing she could pry open his mouth and pour it down his throat.</p><p>Stan removed the cap on his water and took a long swig, then smacked his lips. "This is delicious. I love a woman who takes care of things. My wife doesn&#x2019;t take care of shit. We have a full-time maid and she still complains. She doesn&#x2019;t even know how to put gas in the car."</p><p>"I&#x2019;d rather you didn&#x2019;t talk about your wife." Belinda was an exceptionally attractive woman, but she didn&#x2019;t seem all that bright. She suspected it was one of the reasons Stan had married her. Women like that were easier to dominate. It chapped her that men never gave their wives credit for raising their children. Belinda had three young kids and scores of commitments in the community. She probably worked twice as hard as Stan, and he had an office full of employees to do his bidding.</p><p>"Why? You&#x2019;re always asking me about Belinda."</p><p>She reached into her purse to pay the parking attendant, handing him the ticket stub and a ten-dollar bill. If Stan had been a gentleman, he would have offered to pay for it. She&#x2019;d leased the car, bought the booze, and saved him the cost of the hotel room. Many times it was the little things that showed a person&#x2019;s character. Stan had failed every test. The asshole hadn&#x2019;t even opened the car door for her. "Committing adultery might be a common practice for you, Stan," she said, "but it isn&#x2019;t for me."</p><p>"We&#x2019;re not going to get into a heavy conversation, I hope?" he said, finishing his water and tossing the bottle into the backseat. "If I wanted that, I could have stayed home." He turned sideways in his seat. "Just so you won&#x2019;t feel sorry for her, Belinda lives like a queen. She has a gorgeous home, a new Mercedes, jewelry fit for a queen, and an unlimited spending budget. So what if I get a little action on the side? I&#x2019;m not a monogamous person. I was cheating on my first wife when I started sleeping with Belinda. It&#x2019;s not right for her to expect me to be faithful. She knew what she was getting into before she married me."</p><p>Stan pulled a small package out of his jacket pocket and handed it to her. "I got you a little present. Well, actually, it&#x2019;s the same perfume Belinda wears." He stopped speaking, his jaw dropping. "Shit, I can&#x2019;t believe I said that."</p><p>"Don&#x2019;t worry," she told him. "I don&#x2019;t wear perfume."</p><p>"You&#x2019;re not mad, are you? There are certain precautions I have to take. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m unhappily married. I adore my wife."</p><p>She gave him a stiff smile. "I know the rules, Stan. Don&#x2019;t forget, I have a family, too." The Versed she had placed in his water was beginning to take hold. She dropped the tiny bottle of perfume into her purse, thinking it was probably one of those gift-with-purchase items that the cologne and cosmetic companies gave out periodically. Stan must have swiped it from Belinda. Not only was he an adulterer, he was cheap. She despised cheap men, especially if they had money, and Stan was a millionaire many times over. Of course, poor people didn&#x2019;t become senators. Politics was a playground for the wealthy.</p><p>One guy had gone so far as to ask her to change her hair color to match his wife&#x2019;s. Cheating was a game to them, and they loved every minute. Men wanted to be boys forever with secret decoder rings and tree house hideouts. Former cocaine addicts had told her how they missed using their credit cards to separate the white lines, or rolling up a hundred-dollar bill to snort it. The ritual seemed as addictive as the drug. When it came to men, the same appeared to be true of adultery.</p><p>Men didn&#x2019;t want to get caught, but this fear wasn&#x2019;t there for the right reasons. They didn&#x2019;t want their wives to discover they were having an affair because that would make it harder for them to get away with it the next time.</p><p>Versed was such a dynamite drug that she could say or do anything to Stan right now and he wouldn&#x2019;t remember it. Doctors and anesthetists used it for minor surgery, generally referring to it as conscious sedation. The person might fall asleep, depending on the dosage administered, but could be easily awakened to talk and interact with the physician conducting the procedure. The drug caused an individual to experience amnesia, so when he awoke, he had no memory whatsoever of what had occurred.</p><p>Stan might have chosen his words more carefully if she hadn&#x2019;t dosed his water. She&#x2019;d given him just enough of the drug to relax him, make him oblivious to his surroundings. Without traffic, the trip from LAX to San Bernardino took close to two hours. If he knew, he&#x2019;d pitch a fit. Once they reached the cabin, she would put enough Versed in his Jack Daniel&#x2019;s to render him unconscious. She couldn&#x2019;t do that now because she wasn&#x2019;t strong enough to carry him, at least not in one piece. She took the ramp for the 101 freeway south and began searching for Interstate 10.</p><p>"I can&#x2019;t believe how good I feel around you," Stan said, a goofy grin on his face. "It&#x2019;s like getting stoned without the grass. I haven&#x2019;t been this turned on for years, not since I banged my best friend&#x2019;s wife. I can&#x2019;t wait to get you in the sack." He pulled her hand over the center console and raised his hips so it would reach his genitals.</p><p>"Get your fucking hands off of me," she snarled, yanking her hand away. A moment later, she tempered her anger. Stan wouldn&#x2019;t remember the things she said later, but he would react to them now, and she wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to wrestle a guy while navigating the freeway. "You don&#x2019;t want me to crash the car, do you? Then your wife would find out and you wouldn&#x2019;t get to be a senator."</p><p>"Ah, don&#x2019;t be mean, baby."</p><p>She smiled at him, surprised he was so alert. He had a strong constitution, which she would have to compensate for later. "Traveling is such a hassle today," she said. "You look tired, Stan. Why don&#x2019;t you take a nap? I&#x2019;ll wake you as soon as we get to the cabin."</p><p>"Good idea," he said, sprawling out in the seat and closing his eyes. In no time, he was snoring. He continued that way until she turned onto a bumpy dirt road and reached over and shook his arm. "Man, I must have been exhausted. Where the hell are we?"</p><p>"We&#x2019;re almost there, sleepyhead." She rolled down the window and held her hand outside. "Isn&#x2019;t it beautiful up here? I hate cities in the summer. The smog becomes unbearable." They were in the forest now, surrounded by tall trees and lush foliage. The streaks of sunlight looked like flashlights shining down from the sky. She inhaled a heady mixture of greenery: earth, moisture, and various natural elements. "Smell the air, Stan. And the temperature is perfect. We don&#x2019;t even need air-conditioning."</p><p>The effects of the drug had worn off. Stan rubbed his chin, and then pulled out his cell phone. "Jesus, there&#x2019;s no reception. How am I going to keep in touch with my office?"</p><p>"My cell works, or at least it does from the cabin. I was up here with my uncle about three months ago. Can&#x2019;t you handle your business later? This was supposed to be our time."</p><p>Once they reached the cabin, Stan calmed down, although he still had that dazed, what-the-hell-happened look on his face. She got out and went to unlock the front door, asking him to bring in her suitcase from the trunk of the Hummer. Dropping the keys on the kitchen counter, she grabbed two glasses and opened the refrigerator to get some ice. She then removed a small bottle from her purse and poured a few drops of the Versed syrup into the glass she had just marked with a black Magic Marker. She then plunked an ice cube into each glass and filled them up with Jack Daniel&#x2019;s.</p><p>"Here we go," she said, handing him the drink as soon as he sat her suitcase by the door. "Cheers."</p><p>Stan sipped his drink as he...</p></p><h2>Kindred Spirit, Kindred Care: Making Health Decisions on Behalf of Our Animal Companions</h2><p>Pets are now considered family members, and at the same time, profound changes are taking place in veterinary medicine.

The Quangle Wangle Quee is a tree-dwelling creature obscured by an enormous beribboned hat. He is lonely, but not for long: a procession of animals (some real, some imaginary) discover him, seeing the hat as a possible home. A pair of canaries are the first to arrive, saying, "May we build a nest on your lovely Hat? Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!" By the end of the book, the hat is more built up than one would believe possible, with sheds, nests, shacks, mailboxes, TV antennae, pots of geraniums, and clotheslines. The poem itself is not one of Lear's best works, for the rhythm is not as suited to reading aloud as, for example, "The Jumblies" or "The Owl and the Pussycat." Yet Stevens' use of inventive detail and deadpan silliness is as delightful as it was in her version of The Three Billygoats Gruff (HBJ, 1987). The unkempt and chaotic quality of the illustrations suits both the cumulative and fanciful natures of the poem. --Lauralyn Persson, Wilmette Public Library, Ill.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Little Pony: Rainbow Dash and the Daring Do Double Dare</h2><p>Rainbow Dash is a huge fan of the Daring Do book series, but after the newest book comes out, she's not alone!

But his plotting falls apart faster than his decomposing heroine. There's no explanation (other than its shock value) why the former corn-fed girl-next-door develops an indiscriminate lust for sex after death. And it makes little sense that the rotting Marianne would pursue Kyle back to California, and coerce him into taking her back to the Midwest, complaining, "I can't move around too well by myself." Preposterous coincidences abound, amplifying the story's teen-scream-pic goofiness.

Only now as she sorts through family papers does she begin to know the woman behind the legend of her mother, the revered Salome Urena, who died when Camila was three.</p><p> In stark contrast to Salome, who became the Dominican Republic's national poet at the age of seventeen, Camila has spent most of her life trying not to offend anybody. Her mother dedicated her life to educating young women to give them voice in their turbulent new nation; Camila has spent her life quietly and anonymously teaching the Spanish pluperfect to upper-class American girls with no notion of revolution, no knowledge of Salome Urena.</p><p> Now, in 1960, Camila must choose a final destination for herself. Where will she spend the rest of her days? News of the revolution in Cuba mirrors her own internal upheaval. In the process of deciding her future, Camila uncovers the truth of her mother's tragic personal life and, finally, finds a place for her own passion and commitment.</p><p> Julia Alvarez has won a large and devoted audience by brilliantly illuminating the history of modern Caribbean America through the personal stories of its people. As a Latina, as a poet and novelist, and as a university professor, Julia Alvarez brings her own experience to this exquisite story.</p><p></p></p><p>It's 1960, and 65-year-old Camila Ure�a decides to join the New World. Castro's new world, that is, which she has been following on the news with a heated excitement she hasn't felt for years. Forced into early retirement from her 20-year post as a Spanish teacher among the perky white girls of Vassar College, Camila faces a choice: whether to move to Florida and live down the block from her best friend or to fly over Florida and into Havana where her brothers live--and thereby land in a place of upheaval and hungry ghosts. The hungriest ghost of all is Camila's mother, Salom� Ure�a, whose poems became inspirational anthems for a short-lived revolution in the late-19th-century Dominican Republic.<p> Based in fact, <i>In the Name of Salom�</i> alternates between Camila's story and her mother's. Camila's chapters are written in the third person, Salom�'s in the first. By calling Camila "she," Alvarez alienates her within the text--as if in her attic at Vassar she is floating outside herself in an America that does not belong to her. In contrast, Salom�'s chapters vibrate with life and tears and melodrama. Through the alternating voices, which Alvarez handles masterfully, the reader comes to grasp Camila's longing for the color and music of her mother's lost world--how the meek daughter wishes "she" could become the "I" of her mother's revolutionary and passionate life as a poet, which began under a pseudonym, Herminia, in a local political paper: </p><blockquote> Each time there was a new poem by Herminia in the paper, Mam� would close the front shutters of the house and read it in a whisper to the rest of us. She was delighted with the brave Herminia. I felt guilty keeping this secret from her, but I knew if I told her, all her joy would turn to worry. </blockquote> Yet for Salom�, her pseudonym allows her to become the voice of a country, "and with every link she cracked open for la patria, she was also setting me free." <i>--Emily White</i>This novel tells the story of two women--mother and daughter--and how they confronted the machismo in two Caribbean revolutions. Set in the politically chaotic Dominican Republic of the late nineteenth century, on the campuses of three American universities, and in the idealistic Communist Cuba of the 1960s, this story is based on the real lives of a volatile, opinionated, romantic, intrigue-loving family.<p> Salome Urena's fervent patriotic poems turned her--at seventeen--into the Dominican Republic's national icon. In stark contrast, her daughter, Camila, shy and self-effacing, bent to accommodate the demands of her father and brothers (a president, an ambassador, an international literary star)--trying to hide her preference for women, to stay out of the spotlight, and to offend no one. Whereas her mother dedicated her brief life to educating Dominican girls to serve their turbulent new nation, Camila spent her career anonymously explaining the Spanish pluperfect to upper-class American girls.</p><p> We meet Camila in 1960 when she is sixty-five years old and about to retire from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. This is Camila's last chance to choose a final destiny for herself. In the process of deciding, Camila uncovers first the reality of her mother's tragic personal life and, finally, where she must place her own kind of passion and commitment.</p><p> Latina poet and university professor Alvarez brings many common bonds to this novel based on "la musa de la patra," Salome Urena, and her daughter, Profesora Camila Henriquez-Urena. Not the least of these is an undaunted female stance from inside a powerful Caribbean family.</p></p><h2>The Fabulous Riverboat (Riverworld Saga)</h2><p>Resurrected on the lush, mysterious banks of Riverworld, along with the rest of humanity, Samuel Langhorne Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain) has a dream: to build a riverboat that will rival the most magnificent paddle-wheelers ever navigated on the mighty Mississippi. Then, to steer it up the endless waterway that dominates his new home planet--and at last discover its hidden source.<br><br>But before he can carry out his plan, he first must undertake a dangerous voyage to unearth a fallen meteor. This mission would require striking an uneasy alliance with the bloodthirsty Viking Erik Bloodaxe, treacherous King John of England, legendary French swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac, Greek adventurer Odysseus, and the infamous Nazi Hermann G�ring. All for the purpose of storming the ominous stone tower at the mouth of the river, where the all-powerful overseers of Riverworld--and their secrets--lie in wait . . .</p><p>In <i>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</i>, Philip Jos� Farmer introduces readers to the awesome Riverworld, a planet that had been carved into one large river on whose shores all of humanity throughout the ages has seemingly been resurrected. In <i>The Fabulous Riverboat</i>, Farmer tells the tale of one person whose is uniquely suited to find the river's headwaters, riverboat captain and famous Earthly author Sam Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain). Clemens has been visited by "X," a mysterious being who claims to be a rebel among the group that created Riverworld. X tells Clemens where he can find a large deposit of iron and other materials that Clemens can use to build the greatest riverboat ever seen. Since there is virtually no metal on the planet, it will also give Clemens an unbeatable edge when it comes to battling the various warlike societies that dominate the Riverworld.<p> But Clemens is not alone in his quest for the iron, which arrives on the planet in the form of a giant meteorite. In fact, Clemens is besieged on all sides by forces determined to seize the precious ore, leading him to make a deadly pact with one of history's most notorious villains, John Lackland. Lackland's crimes during his reign as king of England were so hideous that no other English monarch will ever carry his name, and he's up to equally nefarious tricks on Riverworld. However, Clemens has a guardian angel in the form of Joe Miller, a giant subhuman with a big nose, a serious lisp, and a cutting wit.

This is the story of the 158th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army's 45th Division, an Arizona National Guard unit with an unusually varied racial and ethnic composition: men from nearly two dozen Indian tribes, hundreds of Mexican-Americans and draftees and enlistees from throughout the states. After training in Panama, the regiment saw heavy action in the Pacific, including campaigns in New Guinea and the Philippines. The combat material here is superb, but the most distinguished aspect of the narrative is the author's skill in delineating the personalities of selected officers and enlisted men as each coped with the war on his own terms. The final chapter stands by itself as a short classica funny but poignant account of a Bushmaster reunion in Arizona in 1986.

But off the streets another civil rights struggle was also waged, less violent and far less visible but no less momentous, as the vast machinery of the Federal government turned to the task of securing equal rights.<br> <em>The Civil Rights Era</em> offers the first comprehensive history of this other side of the battle for civil rights. Based on extensive research in the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon presidential archives, the National Archives, and special collections of the Library of Congress, this groundbreaking study recreates the intense debates in Congress and the White House that led to the breakthrough laws of 1964 and 1965--the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act--which banned discrimination against minorities and women. Graham then follows the implementation of these policies through a thickening maze of federal agencies and court decisions. In so doing, he reveals exactly how, in the dozen years from Kennedy through Nixon, the classic liberal agenda of non-discrimination evolved into the controversial program of affirmative action. Lyndon Johnson emerges as a key figure, but surprisingly enough, it was Richard Nixon who established the preferential quotas of the Philadelphia Plan. There are other surprising findings as well: for instance, Graham argues that despite similarities in rhetoric and tactics, the black civil rights and feminist movements during the 1960s switched philosophical positions. While black organizations shifted their demands from a "color-blind Constitution" to racial preferences, feminist leaders rejected special-protection laws in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment.<br> <em>The Civil Rights Era</em> represents the definitive account of a revolution in government policy, offering keen insight into the civil rights legacy currently being challenged by the Supreme Court. Brilliantly researched and intelligently written, it offers a behind-the-scenes look at a pivotal moment in American history.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em> <br> <strong>Hugh Davis Graham</strong> is Professor of History and Policy Sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and is the author of <em>The Uncertain Triumph</em>.<br>Graham (history, Univ. of Maryland) has taken a unique approach to the civil rights revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. He has eschewed the dramatic--protests, violence--to focus on "the obscure and complex phase of implementation" of laws. This work, then, becomes the first administrative history of this movement. Central to Graham's approach is a clear sense of irony, as he traces a tortuous bureaucratic path. What began in the early 1960s as "negative" laws and regulations to protect blacks from discrimination became in the 1970s affirmative action decisions, which included women as well as blacks. The book is a major milestone in the study of recent American life and politics. Given its thoroughness and complexity, it will be most useful for experts in the field.<br><i>- Anthony O.

Detective Kurt Wallander is not officially involved in the investigation but he has personal reasons for his interest in the case as Hakan&#39;s son is engaged to his daughter Linda.

She&#x2019;d married each of her three bestfriends&#x2014;as both bride and groom&#x2014;her best friend&#x2019;s brother(under his protest), two dogs, three cats, and a rabbit.She&#x2019;d served at countless other weddings as maid of honor,bridesmaid, groomsman, best man, and officiant.Though the dissolutions were invariably amicable, none ofthe marriages lasted beyond an afternoon. The transitory aspectof marriage came as no surprise to Mac, as her own parentsboasted two each&#x2014;so far.</p><p>Wedding Day wasn&#x2019;t her favorite game, but she kind of likedbeing the priest or the reverend or the justice of the peace. Or,after attending her father&#x2019;s second wife&#x2019;s nephew&#x2019;s bar mitzvah,the rabbi.</p><p>Plus, she enjoyed the cupcakes or fancy cookies and fizzylemonade always served at the reception.</p><p>It was Parker&#x2019;s favorite game, and Wedding Day always took place on the Brown Estate, with its expansive gardens, prettygroves, and silvery pond. In the cold Connecticut winters, theceremony might take place in front of one of the roaring firesinside the big house.</p><p>They had simple weddings and elaborate affairs. Royal weddings,star- crossed elopements, circus themes, and pirate ships.All ideas were seriously considered and voted upon, and notheme or costume too outrageous.</p><p>Still, with fourteen marriages under her belt, Mac grew a bitweary of Wedding Day.</p><p>Until she experienced her seminal moment.</p><p>For her eighth birthday Mackensie&#x2019;s charming and mostlyabsent father sent her a Nikon camera. She&#x2019;d never expressedany interest in photography, and initially pushed it away withthe other odd gifts he&#x2019;d given or sent since the divorce. ButMac&#x2019;s mother told her mother, and Grandma muttered and complainedabout &#x201c;feckless, useless Geoffrey Elliot&#x201d; and the inappropriategift of an adult camera for a young girl who&#x2019;d be betteroff with a Barbie doll.</p><p>As she habitually disagreed with her grandmother on principle,Mac&#x2019;s interest in the camera piqued. To annoy Grandma&#x2014;who was visiting for the summer instead of being in herretirement community in Scottsdale, where Mac strongly believedshe belonged&#x2014;Mac hauled the Nikon around with her.She toyed with it, experimented. She took pictures of her room,of her feet, of her friends. Shots that were blurry and dark, orfuzzy and washed out. With her lack of success, and her mother&#x2019;simpending divorce from her stepfather, Mac&#x2019;s interest in theNikon began to wane. Even years later she couldn&#x2019;t say whatprompted her to bring it along to Parker&#x2019;s that pretty summerafternoon for Wedding Day.</p><p>Every detail of the traditional garden wedding had beenplanned. Emmaline as the bride and Laurel as groom would exchangetheir vows beneath the rose arbor. Emma would wear the lace veil and train Parker&#x2019;s mother had made out of an oldtablecloth, while Harold, Parker&#x2019;s aging and affable goldenretriever walked her down the garden path to give her away.A selection of Barbies, Kens, and Cabbage Patch Kids, alongwith a variety of stuffed animals lined the path as guests.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a very private ceremony,&#x201d; Parker relayed as she fussedwith Emma&#x2019;s veil. &#x201c;With a small patio reception to follow.Now, where&#x2019;s the best man?&#x201d;</p><p>Laurel, her knee recently skinned, shoved through a trio ofhydrangeas. &#x201c;He ran away, and went up a tree after a squirrel.I can&#x2019;t get him to come down.&#x201d;</p><p>Parker rolled her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get him. You&#x2019;re not supposed tosee the bride before the wedding. It&#x2019;s bad luck. Mac, you need tofix Emma&#x2019;s veil and get her bouquet. Laurel and I&#x2019;ll get Mr. Fish out of the tree.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather go swimming,&#x201d; Mac said as she gave Emma&#x2019;s veilan absent tug.</p><p>&#x201c;We can go after I get married.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess. Aren&#x2019;t you tired of getting married?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t mind. And it smells so good out here. Everything&#x2019;sso pretty.&#x201d;</p><p>Mac gave Emma the clutch of dandelions and wild violetsthey were allowed to pick. &#x201c;You look pretty.&#x201d;</p><p>It was invariably true. Emma&#x2019;s dark, shiny hair tumbled underthe white lace. Her eyes sparkled a deep, deep brown as shesniff ed the weed bouquet. She was tanned, sort of all golden,Mac thought, and scowled at her own milk white skin.</p><p>The curse of a redhead, her mother said, as she got her carrotyhair from her father. At eight, Mac was tall for her age andskinny as a stick, with teeth already trapped in hated braces.She thought that, beside her, Emmaline looked like a gypsyprincess.</p><p>Parker and Laurel came back, giggling with the feline bestman clutched in Parker&#x2019;s arms. &#x201c;Everybody has to take theirplaces.&#x201d; Parker poured the cat into Laurel&#x2019;s arms. Mac, you needto get dressed! Emma&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be maid of honor.&#x201d; Mac looked at the poofyCinderella dress draped over a garden bench. &#x201c;That thing&#x2019;sscratchy, and it&#x2019;s hot. Why can&#x2019;t Mr. Fish be maid of honor, andI&#x2019;ll be best man?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s already planned. Everybody&#x2019;s nervous before awedding.&#x201d; Parker flipped back her long brown pigtails, thenpicked up the dress to inspect it for tears or stains. Satisfied, shepushed it at Mac. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. It&#x2019;s going to be a beautiful ceremony,with true love and happy ever after.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My mother says happy ever after&#x2019;s a bunch of bull.&#x201d; </p><p>There was a moment of silence after Mac&#x2019;s statement. Theunspoken word <i>divorce </i> seemed to hang in the air.&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it has to be.&#x201d; Her eyes full of sympathy, Parkerreached out, ran her hand along Mac&#x2019;s bare arm.</p><p> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to wear the dress. I don&#x2019;t want to be a bridesmaid.I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. That&#x2019;s okay. We can have a pretend maid of honor.Maybe you could take pictures.&#x201d;</p><p>Mac looked down at the camera she&#x2019;d forgotten hung aroundher neck. &#x201c;They never come out right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe they will this time. It&#x2019;ll be fun. You can be the official wedding photographer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take one of me and Mr. Fish,&#x201d; Laurel insisted, and pushedher face and the cat&#x2019;s together. &#x201c;Take one, Mac!&#x201d;</p><p>With little enthusiasm, Mac lifted the camera, pressed theshutter.</p><p>&#x201c;We should&#x2019;ve thought of this before! You can take formalportraits of the bride and groom, and more pictures during theceremony.&#x201d; Busy with the new idea, Parker hung the Cinderellacostume on the hydrangea bush. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be good, it&#x2019;ll be fun. Youneed to go down the path with the bride and Harold. Try totake some good ones. I&#x2019;ll wait, then start the music. Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;</p><p>There would be cupcakes and lemonade, Mac reminded herself.And swimming later, and fun. It didn&#x2019;t matter if the pictureswere stupid, didn&#x2019;t matter that her grandmother was rightand she was too young for the camera.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter that her mother was getting divorced again,or that her stepfather, who&#x2019;d been okay, had already moved out.It didn&#x2019;t matter that happy ever after was bull, because it wasall pretend anyway.</p><p>She tried to take pictures of Emma and the obliging Harold,imagined getting the film back and seeing the blurry figures andsmudges of her thumb, like always.</p><p>When the music started she felt bad that she hadn&#x2019;t put onthe scratchy dress and given Emma a maid of honor, just becauseher mother and grandmother had put her in a bad mood. So shecircled around to stand to the side and tried harder to take anice picture of Harold walking Emma down the garden path.It looked different through the lens, she thought, the way shecould focus on Emma&#x2019;s face&#x2014;the way the veil lay over her hair.And the way the sun shined through the lace was pretty.</p><p>She took more pictures as Parker began the &#x201c;Dearly Beloved&#x201d;as the Reverend Whistledown, as Emma and Laurel took handsand Harold curled up to sleep and snore at their feet.</p><p>She noticed how bright Laurel&#x2019;s hair was, how the sun caughtthe edges of it beneath the tall black hat she wore as groom.How Mr. Fish&#x2019;s whiskers twitched as he yawned.</p><p>When it happened, it happened as much inside Mac as out.Her three friends were grouped under the lush white curve ofthe arbor, a triangle of pretty young girls. Some instinct had Macshifting her position, just slightly, tilting the camera just a bit.She didn&#x2019;t know it as composition, only that it looked nicerthrough the lens.</p><p>And the blue butterfly fluttered across her range of vision toland on the head of a butter yellow dandelion in Emma&#x2019;s bouquet.The surprise and plea sure struck the three faces in thattriangle under the white roses almost as one.</p><p>Mac pressed the shutter.</p><p>She knew, <i>knew</i>, the photograph wouldn&#x2019;t be blurry and darkor fuzzy and washed out. Her thumb wouldn&#x2019;t be blocking thelens. She knew exactly what the picture would look like, knewher grandmother had been wrong after all.</p><p>Maybe happy ever after was bull, but she knew she wantedto take more pictures of moments that <i>were </i> happy. Because thenthey were ever after.</p><b>CHAPTER ONE<p></p></b><p></p><p>On January first, Mac rolled over to smack her alarmclock, and ended up facedown on the floor of her studio.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit. Happy New Year.&#x201d;</p><p>She lay, groggy and baffled, until she remembered she&#x2019;dnever made it upstairs into bed&#x2014;and the alarm was from hercomputer, set to wake her at noon.</p><p>She pushed herself up to stagger to the kitchen and the coffeemaker.Why did people want to get married on New Year&#x2019;s Eve?Why would they make a formal ritual out of a holiday designedfor marathon drinking and probably inappropriate sex? Andthey just had to drag family and friends into it, not to mentionwedding photographers.</p><p>Of course, when the reception had finally ended at two a.m.,she could&#x2019;ve gone to bed like a sane person instead of uploadingthe shots, reviewing them&#x2014;spending nearly three more hourson the Hines- Myers wedding photos.</p><p>But, boy, she&#x2019;d gotten some good ones. A few great ones.Or they were all crap and she&#x2019;d judged them in a euphoricblur.</p><p>No, they were good shots.</p><p>She added three spoons of sugar to the black coffee anddrank it while standing at the window, looking out at the snowblanketing the gardens and lawns of the Brown Estate.</p><p>They&#x2019;d done a good job on the wedding, she thought. Andmaybe Bob Hines and Vicky Myers would take a clue from thatand do a good job on the marriage.</p><p>Either way, the memories of the day wouldn&#x2019;t fade. The moments,big and small, were captured. She&#x2019;d refine them, finessethem, print them. Bob and Vicky could revisit the day throughthose images next week or sixty years from next week.</p><p>That, she thought, was as potent as sweet, black coffee on acold winter day.</p><p>Opening a cupboard, she pulled out a box of Pop- Tarts and,eating one where she stood, went over her schedule for the day.Clay- McFearson (Rod and Alison) wedding at six. Whichmeant the bride and her party would arrive by three, groom andhis by four. That gave her until two for the pre- event summitmeeting at the main house.</p><p>Time enough to shower, dress, go over her notes, check andrecheck her equipment. Her last check of the day&#x2019;s weathercalled for sunny skies, high of thirty- two. She should be able toget some nice preparation shots using natural light and maybetalk Alison&#x2014;if she was game&#x2014;into a bridal portrait on the balconywith the snow in the background.</p><p>Mother of the bride, Mac remembered&#x2014;Dorothy (call meDottie)&#x2014;was on the pushy and demanding side, but she&#x2019;d bedealt with. If Mac couldn&#x2019;t handle her personally, God knewParker would. Parker could and did handle anyone and anything.Parker&#x2019;s drive and determination had turned Vows into one ofthe top wedding and event planning companies in the state in afi ve- year period. It had turned the tragedy of her parents&#x2019; deathsinto hope, and the gorgeous Victorian home and the stunninggrounds of the Brown Estate into a thriving and unique business.And, Mac thought as she swallowed the last of the Pop- Tart,she herself was one of the reasons.</p><p>She moved through the studio toward the stairs to her upstairsbed and bath, stopped at one of her favorite photos. Theglowing, ecstatic bride with her face lifted, her arms stretched,palms up, caught in a shower of pink rose petals.Cover of <i>Today&#x2019;s Bride</i>, Mac thought. Because I&#x2019;m just thatgood.</p><p>In her thick socks, flannel pants, and sweatshirt she climbedthe stairs to transform herself from tired, pj- clad, Pop- Tart addictinto sophisticated wedding photojournalist.</p><p>She ignored her unmade bed&#x2014;why make it when you werejust going to mess it up again?&#x2014;and the bedroom clutter. Thehot shower worked with the sugar and caffeine to clear out anyremaining cobwebs so she could put her mind seriously to today&#x2019;sjob.</p><p>She had a bride who was interested in trying the creative, apassive- aggressive MOB who thought she knew best, a groomso dazzling in love he&#x2019;d do anything to make his bride happy.And both her B and G were seriously photogenic.</p><p>The last fact made the job both plea sure and challenge. Justhow could she give her clients a photo journey of their day thatwas spectacular, and uniquely theirs?</p><p>Bride&#x2019;s colors, she thought, flipping through her mental fi lesas she washed her short, shaggy crop of red hair. Silver and gold.Elegant, glamorous.</p><p>She&#x2019;d had a look at the flowers and the cake&#x2014;both gettingtheir finishing touches today&#x2014;the favors and linens, attendants&#x2019;wardrobes, headdresses. She had a copy of the playlist from theband with the first dance, mother- son, father- daughter danceshighlighted.</p><p>So, she thought, for the next several hours, her world wouldrevolve around Rod and Alison.</p><p>She chose her suit, her jewelry, her makeup with nearly thesame care as she chose her equipment. Loaded, she went out tomake the short trek from the pool house that held her studio andlittle apartment to the main house.</p><p>The snow sparkled, crushed diamonds over ermine, and theair was cold and clean as mountain ice. She definitely had to getsome outside shots, daylight and evening. Winter wedding,white wedding, snow on the ground, ice glistening on the trees,just dripping from the denuded willows over the pond. Andthere the fanciful old Victorian with its myriad rooflines, thearched and porthole windows, rising and spreading, soft blueagainst the hard shell of sky. Its terraces and generous porticoheralded the season with their festoons of lights and greenery.</p><p>She studied it as she often did as she walked the shoveledpaths. She loved the lines of it, the angles of it, with its subtletouches of pale yellow, creamy white picked out in that soft, subtleblue.</p><p>It had been as much home to her as her own growing up.Often more so, she admitted, as her own had run on her mother&#x2019;scapricious whims. Parker&#x2019;s parents had been warm, welcoming,loving and&#x2014;Mac thought now&#x2014;steady. They&#x2019;d given her acalm port in the storm of her own childhood.</p><p>She&#x2019;d grieved as much as her friend at their loss nearly sevenyears before.</p><p>Now the Brown Estate was her home. Her business. Her life.And a good one on every level. What could be better than doingsomething you loved, and doing it with the best friendsyou&#x2019;d ever had?</p><p>She went in through the mudroom to hang up her outdoorgear, then circled around to peek into Laurel&#x2019;s domain.Her friend and partner stood on a step stool, meticulouslyadding silver calla lilies to the five tiers of a wedding cake.

But this year there'd be no cheer for the widower and his twelve-year-old daughter, Bridget. For New York City had taken Christy's only son, headstrong sixteen-year-old Danny, who'd run off without a trace.<br><br>Librarian Catherine Tierney used to love the holidays: the lights, the carols, the nip in the air. But after her husband's death on Christmas Eve three years ago, the festivities seemed to start too early and last too long.

On the quaint Chelsea street where she lives, Catherine will meet the tree seller from Novia Scotia. Both figured the world had forgotten the true meaning of Christmas. But they hadn't counted on finding each other, on fate, on second chances. . . and on a holiday gift of new love and new hope to last a lifetime.</p><p>Luanne Rice is the author of <b>Secrets of Paris</b>, <b>Stone Heart</b>, <b>Angels All Over Town</b>, <b>Blue Moon</b>, <b>Home Fires</b>, and <b>Crazy in Love</b>, which was made into a TNT Network feature movie. She lives in Old Lyme, Connecticut and New York City with her husband.<i>Chapter One</i><br>All summer long the trees had grown tall and full, roots deep in the rich island soil, branches yearning toward the golden sun. The salt wind had blown in from the east, gilding the pine needles silver. Everyone knew that the best Christmas trees came from the north, with the best of all coming from Nova Scotia, where the stars hung low in the sky. It was said that starlight lodged in the branches, the northern lights charged the needles with magic. Nova Scotia trees were made hardy by the sea and luminous by the stars.<br><br>On Cape Breton's Pleasant Bay, in the remote north of Nova Scotia, was a tree farm owned by Christopher Byrne. His family had immigrated to Canada from Ireland when he was a child; they'd answered an ad to work on a Christmas tree farm. It was brutally hard work, and they were very poor, and Christy remembered going to sleep with a gnawing hunger in his belly.<br><br>By the time he was twelve, he was six feet tall, growing too fast for the family to afford&#x2014;and his mother had often sacrificed her own food so her oldest child would have enough to eat. He'd need it to withstand the elements. For the north wind would roar, and Arctic snows would fly, and summer heat would blaze into flash fires, and Christy would work through it all. His mother would ring the dinner bell, to call them home from the field. He loved that sound, for no matter how little they had, his mother would do her best to make sure Christy had more than enough love and almost enough food.<br><br>His hunger had made Christy Byrne a fierce worker, and it had given him a wicked drive for success. He saved every penny he made, buying land of his own, using the skills and instincts he'd learned from his father to plant his trees and survive the brutal elements. His mother's love and generosity had made Christy a fine man, and that had made him a good father. He knew he was a good father. It couldn't be in doubt; he had a fire in his heart for his children. So that was why this year, cutting the trees on the mountainside in preparation for going south to sell them, he felt such a storm of hope and confusion.<br><br>Every year on the first day of December, Christy drove south to New York City. Hordes of tree salespeople would descend upon the glittering island of Manhattan, from the flatlands of Winnipeg, the snowy forests north of Toronto and east of Quebec, the green woodlands of Vermont and Maine, the lakes of Wisconsin, the lonely peninsulas of Michigan. Their trees would be cut and tied, hauled by flatbed trucks over the brilliant garland bridges spanning the East and Hudson Rivers, offloaded on street corners from Little Italy to Gramercy Park, from Tribeca to Morningside Heights, in the hopes of making a year's worth of income from one month's worth of selling.<br><br>A scruffy bunch, the tree salespeople were. Dungarees and Carhartt jackets were their uniform. Some arrived in caravans, like Gypsies, parked their trailers by the curb, and lived out December in the vans' cramped chill, carbon monoxide pumping out along with the meager heat. Some would stick a huge illuminated Santa or snowman on the van roof.<br><br>When it came to vending Christmas trees, Christy had no peer. He used to leave his family behind and travel alone&#x2014;set up his stand on the corner in Chelsea, string up white lights to show off his trees with their salt-sparkle, and use his silver Irish tongue to sell every last one at top dollar in time to get home on Christmas Eve&#x2014;laden with sugarplums, walnuts, fine chocolates, and cheeses from the best Manhattan markets; golden-haired dolls, tin soldiers, silver skates, and Flexible Flyer sleds for Bridget and Danny; soft red wool sweaters and fine cream silk nightgowns for Mary. Why not spend some of the profits on his family? He'd made plenty off the glamorous people of New York City.<br><br>He'd go home and tell everyone about it, tell Danny what he had to look forward to. "We'll be partners, you and I," Christy had said. "When you get old enough, you're going to own half this farm. Study up in school, son. You can't take farming for granted. You've got to be a scientist&#x2014;learn all about weather patterns, and soil acidity, and grubs."<br><br>"You're saying it takes book knowledge? To be a farmer?" Mary had asked, laughing. Christy had held in his hurt&#x2014;she'd never appreciated the skills it took. Her father had done two years of college in Halifax, worked in the front office of a lobster company, and Christy knew she had similar designs for their son.<br><br>"That, and instincts," Christy had replied, aware that Danny was listening, wanting him to be proud of his tree-farming heritage. "Running the land takes the best we have&#x2014;all of it! It's magical work, it is, to make Christmas trees grow out of nothing much more than sun and dirt."<br><br>"And precipitation," Danny had said. "Moderate rainfall and occluded fronts." Christy had laughed affectionately at the big words and the serious look in his boy's eyes.<br><br>But after Mary's death four years ago, he had had to take the children with him to New York. Danny had been twelve then, and Bridget eight. The school always gave them permission, along with a month's worth of lessons and homework to do while their father hustled the trees. Danny's eyes had just about sprung out of his head, the first time he saw the city: the towers, bridges, fancy stores.<br><br>"This is New York City?" he'd asked that first year, mesmerized. "It's so&#x2014;big, Pa! Like a forest of buildings, all lit up."<br><br>"Just don't lose sight of the farm," Christy had warned.<br><br>"Never, Pa," Danny had said.<br><br>So Christy would rent two rooms at Mrs. Quinn's boardinghouse right there on Ninth Avenue, where he could keep an eye on the trees. A big room for him and Danny, a smaller one for Bridget&#x2014;he could afford it, because his blue and white spruces, Douglas firs, and Scotch pines were the best, and he could always get the rich New Yorkers to pay half again as much as they would for the trees on other street corners. He would rig a chain around the trees, so no one could steal them&#x2014;and he'd sleep with one eye open, besides. He'd put nothing past New Yorkers&#x2014;the street people would take anything, and the moneyed people would get away with what they could.<br><br>"It's how the rich get richer," he'd say.<br><br>Mary used to chide him for his cynical attitude about the wealthy denizens of Manhattan. "Christy, <br>they're paying our way the year round. They've been meeting the mortgage on our land, and they're going to pay for college&#x2014;if you'll ever let Danny off the farm long enough to go. So don't go putting your mouth on them!"<br><br>"Ah, they've got so much money, they don't even notice the air they breathe," Christy said, ignoring her dig. "They don't notice the snow, except to complain that it ruins their expensive shoes. They're so busy rushing to get out of the wind, they forget to feel the sting on their faces, letting them know they're alive."<br><br>"Well, you're happy enough to take their dollars," she'd say.<br><br>"That I am," Christy would laugh. "Believe me, they've enough so they won't miss it. If I doubled my prices, I'd probably sell out twice as fast&#x2014;the rich people love to spend their money, and if something costs them a lot, it gives them a reason to swagger."<br><br>"You're a scandal, Christy Byrne," Mary would say, shaking her head. "Selling Christmas trees with that kind of a mentality is some kind of a sin, it is. It's going to get you in trouble&#x2014;mark my words."<br><br>Mary's family had been comfortable, and she'd never gone to bed hungry. What did she know? He'd ask himself in the tree fields wet with rain, the short, enchanted Nova Scotia summers when he'd walk along the crystal-cool streams, feeling the rapture of summer's breeze as he pruned the spruces' golden growth into Christmas tree shapes, calculating the handsome dividends they'd bring in December.<br><br>This year, with the power saws roaring like demons, spitting out wood chips in their vicious, hellish destruction of nature's best, Christy knew that Mary had been right. Last winter Manhattan&#x2014;for all the money it had given him over the years&#x2014;had exacted the greatest price imaginable, interest on all his profits, on what Mary had called his greed, compounded beyond comprehension: New York City had taken his only son.<br><br>Three years of city lights had proven too much temptation for the teenage boy. And last Christmas Eve, after a banner season of tree selling, Danny had informed his father he wasn't returning home to Nova Scotia with him and Bridget. He was going to stay in New York&#x2014;find a job, make his way.<br><br>"What do you mean," Christy had asked, " 'make your way'?"<br><br>"Let me go, Pa&#x2014;I can't talk about it anymore! You don't get it!"<br><br>"Staying in New York? Are you mad, Danny?"<br><br>The tension between them was terrible. Christy grabbed his sleeve, felt Danny pulling away&#x2014;literally yanking his arm back. And that made Christy hold on tighter.<br><br>"There's no talking about this," Danny said. "There never was. It's just your way, Pa&#x2014;the farm. I have something I want to do right now. It's my dream, Pa. And I have to follow it! You've taught me not to waste time talking when work needs to be done."<br><br>Danny was serious, and he was right: Christy had taught him that very thing. Talking took up too much time, when there was a whole farm that needed tending to. Of course, what Danny didn't know was that Christy was afraid of talking. He feared his children asking him questions he didn't know the answers to, telling him things that would stir up his emotions. He loved his kids with passion beyond words.<br><br>Now Danny was staring at his father with the resolute, not-to-be-deterred eyes of a dreamer.

Across five decades, Prine has created critically acclaimed albums&#x2014;John Prine (one of Rolling Stone&#x2019;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time), Bruised Orange, and The Missing Years&#x2014;and earned many honors, including two Grammy Awards, a Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting from the Americana Music Association, and induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. His songs have been covered by scores of artists, from Johnny Cash and Miranda Lambert to Bette Midler and 10,000 Maniacs, and have influenced everyone from Roger McGuinn to Kacey Musgraves. Hailed in his early years as the &#x201c;new Dylan,&#x201d; Prine still counts Bob Dylan among his most enthusiastic fans. In John Prine, Eddie Huffman traces the long arc of Prine&#x2019;s musical career, beginning with his early, seemingly effortless successes, which led paradoxically not to stardom but to a rich and varied career writing songs that other people have made famous. He recounts the stories, many of them humorous, behind Prine&#x2019;s best-known songs and discusses all of Prine&#x2019;s albums as he explores the brilliant records and the ill-advised side trips, the underappreciated gems and the hard-earned comebacks that led Prine to found his own successful record label, Oh Boy Records. This thorough, entertaining treatment gives John Prine his due as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation.</p><p>Eddie Huffman, a regular contributor to the Greensboro (NC) News &amp; Record and the Winston-Salem (NC) Journal, has written for Rolling Stone, the New York Times, Utne Reader, All Music Guide, Goldmine, the Virgin Islands Source, and many other publications."Prine&#x2019;s stuff is pure Proustian existentialism.

Her deeply personal poems echo everything from nursery rhymes to classics, revealing poetry buried in ordinary speech. Whether remonstrating with a former lover or evoking her young children, the poet who reveals herself here is appealingly vulnerable yet gutsy, by turns blunt and tender.

The dynamics that underlie this painful way of relating often escape clinical attention, and people with subtle yet pervasive masochistic problems may endure painful relationships without seeking treatment. In Treatment of the Masochistic Personality: An Interactional-Object Relations Approach to Psychotherapy, Cheryl Glickauf-Hughes and Marolyn Wells use contemporary psychoanalytic thinking to probe the functions of masochism underlying human interaction - particularly love relations. From a relational perspective, masochism is not associated with that which is feminine and signifies neither a primarily sexual phenomenon nor the deriving of pleasure from pain. Rather, masochism is viewed as a self-defeating way of loving and individuating that reflects a pathology of object relations. According to Glickauf-Hughes and Wells, pathological loving can include any of the following dynamics: loving someone who predominantly gives no love in return, confusing self-negation and suffering with love, protecting the idealized image of an unsatisfying love object and choosing critical and rejecting love objects in the never-ending hope of gaining their approval through self-sacrifice.

Beginning with the Clinton family&#39;s long-standing ties to the notorious Dixie Mafia, this book illustrates how billions of dollars of cocaine, cash and weapons passed through Mena, Arkansas during the 1980s-with the the full knowledge of Bill and Hillary-to finance the illegal war in Nica ragua. (Tons of this CIA-imported coke help fuel the cocaine epidemic of the 1980s) In short, Bill and Hillary&#39;s Arkansas became nothing less than a narco-republic, with little banks near Mena laundering more money than the big banks in New York City. As this thoroughly sourced tale unfolds, the reader encounters a sordid cast of characters including George Bush the Elder (who ran the operation from the office of the VP in D.C.), Oliver North, Manuel Noriega, Webster Hubbell, Barry Seal, Dan Lasater and the Stephens Brothers. In addition, an undeniable amount of evidence proves that nearly every one of Bill Clinton&#39;s gubernatorial campaigns - including his 1992 presidential bid - was substantially financed with cocaine money. The author also includes a wealth of information on the larger implications of Whitewater, the BCCI banking scandal, Travelgate, Filegate and novice stock investor Hillary Clinton&#39;s infamous-and mind-boggling-windfall profits derived from trading cattle futures. Also, how the Clintons continually escaped paying for their crimes by firing every U.S. attorney in D.C and appointing friends (many corrupt) as judges.

Toby O&#x2019;Dare&#x2014;aka Lucky the Fox&#x2014;is a contract killer on assignment once again. He&#x2019;s a soulless soul, a dead man walking. His nightmarish world of lone and lethal missions is disrupted when a mysterious stranger, a seraph, offers him a chance to save rather than destroy lives. O&#x2019;Dare, who long ago dreamt of being a priest, seizes his chance. Now he is carried back through the ages to thirteenth-century England, to dark realms where children suddenly die or disappear, and accusations of ritual murder have been made against Jews. Here O&#x2019;Dare begins his perilous quest for salvation, a journey of danger and flight, loyalty and betrayal, selflessness and love.<br></p></p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Anne Rice</strong> <br> <p> </p> <b>Question:</b> You&#x2019;ve written about many kinds of immortal or supernatural beings. What inspired you to turn to angels in this new book?<p></p> <p><b>Anne Rice:</b> I have always been fascinated by the idea of angels--these perfect beings who are God&#x2019;s messengers, sinless, bold, and unfathomable to the human mind. I was deliciously challenged to be biblically correct about them, and theologically correct: to present Malchiah as truly perfect, yet sent to interact with my hero Toby, and commissioned therefore to take a human body and reflect human emotions and respond to Toby&#x2019;s human emotions.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> How did imagining a character like Malchiah the angel differ from creating one like the vampire Lestat?</p> <p><b>Anne Rice:</b> Well, again, Malchiah is perfect and sinless. And to make such a character appealing is a challenge; he has to reflect God&#x2019;s love for human beings, God&#x2019;s compassion. He&#x2019;s not sent to judge Toby; he&#x2019;s sent to guide him to salvation, and to enlist Toby in working for the angels on earth. He must feel things; he must have a personality, but with marvelous theological constraints. Doing Lestat was entirely different: Lestat is sinful and ferociously human, a rebel who wants to be good at being bad; a rebel who is seeking redemption but turning away from it all the time. There is a certain joy in writing about Malchiah because he is sent from God. There was never a perfect joy in writing about Lestat: Lestat suffers too much and does too many bad things with relish.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> The hero of <i>Angel Time</i> is Toby O&#x2019;Dare, a boy who had a tough life growing up in New Orleans and who goes on to become a skilled assassin before meeting Malchiah. How does Toby compare to your past protagonists? What is unique about him?</p> <p><b>Anne Rice:</b> Well, Toby is deeply flawed, much like the vampires. He&#x2019;s an assassin, and he has done terrible things, and questionable things. But he turns around in the very first book of the series and sets out to do the bidding of the angels in helping others. I think of all those characters I&#x2019;ve created, Toby is most like Michael Curry in <i>The Witching Hour</i>. But Toby has done things Michael would never do. Toby is a deeply flawed human who is offered a chance to be saved; and he takes it. Maybe he&#x2019;s a first among my characters in that he is given an opportunity to redeem himself through the mercy of God, and then to do good to make up for all the evil he had done before. Toby is also a crafty character. He&#x2019;s pragmatic. Having been a clever assassin, he knows how to plot to do good. That was interesting to me, to have him struggling to save people from harm, and having to figure out a somewhat complex way to do it.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> People who have read your memoir <i>Called Out of Darkness</i> will recognize some elements of your own life in Toby&#x2019;s story. Did you identify with him as a character?</p> <p><b>Anne Rice:</b> Yes, I did identify with Toby, though my life has been nothing like his. I know what it is like to struggle with an alcoholic parent; I know what it is like to care for younger siblings in an alcoholic household. But of course Toby suffers a family tragedy that I didn&#x2019;t suffer, and he turns to evil in a defiant way, whereas I only turned to writing about evil.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> How did you imagine the concept of Angel Time (as opposed to Normal Time)? And what sources did you reference while reading about angels?</p> <p><b>Anne Rice:</b> I came up with the concept of Angel Time through meditating on it; really, figuring that from God&#x2019;s standpoint there is no linear time. I felt certain that the angels would be able to move back and forth in our linear time, and to grasp how some one can be lifted from one century and put down in another to work a solution that then becomes part of the very future from which the original person came. I think meditation led to this definition of Angel Time, more than any actual reading. It seemed logical to me that the angels could do this. I did read theology about angels, of course, including St. Thomas Aquinas and books by Catholic writers who have studied angels and all the biblical references to them. It all starts with the Bible, of course and how angels appear in those pages. But the scholars Pascal Parente and Peter Kreeft help me to cover the sources. I stayed away from other writers&#x2019; more fanciful conjectures about angels. I wanted the biblical facts, and the way that the theologians interpreted them. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> People are clearly fascinated with angels. Why do you think even those people who do not consider themselves religious are so drawn to the idea of angels?</p> <p><b>Anne Rice:</b> People are drawn to angels because there is a deep seated instinctive belief that they do exist, that creatures from Heaven are here on Earth looking out for us and playing a special role in our care. Of course we read of this in the Bible. And it is a very seductive idea. It&#x2019;s sometimes easier to pray to one&#x2019;s guardian angel than to pray to the saints or even to the Lord. It&#x2019;s easy to imagine that our guardian angel is right here with us. In my novel, Toby really does believe this, though after he suffered tragedy, he blamed the angels in charge for not stopping it. And he lived as a cursed human being for ten years.</p><p>Anne Rice&nbsp;is the author of thirty-five books.

Largely culled from Bianco's newspaper column "Past Out," the entries in Gay Essentials are succinct, witty, and anecdotal. Bianco does a sensible, entertaining job of covering the kind of history that isn't taught in most schoolsAbut his work leaves one with the feeling that it could have been much more. Bianco reveals a strong, unnoted bias toward people and events in the United States, and some of the biographical details should probably be taken with a grain of salt. In the end, this book is more like the People's Almanac than a true reference work. It does, however, contain an excellent bibliography for those who seek more depth.

But in the shadows at the far end of the bar there stood a rough&#x2014;hewn, tightly closed door. And in the room behind that door, Benedetto Madonia sat eating his last supper. &nbsp; <br><br>The place was advertised as a spaghetti restaurant, but it was in truth an eating house of the most basic sort. An old stove squatted against one wall, belching fumes. Musty strings of garlic dangled from the walls, mingling their odor with the smell of boiling vegetables. The remaining fittings consisted of several rough, low tables, a handful of ancient chairs, and a rusting iron sink that jutted from a corner of the room. Gas lamps spewed out mustard light, and the naked floorboards had been scattered with cedar sawdust, which, at the end of a busy day, coagulated in a thick mix of spit, onion skins, and the butts of dark Italian cigars. &nbsp; <br><br> Madonia dug hungrily into a stew of beans, beets, and potatoes, hearty peasant food from his home province of Palermo. He was a powerfully built man of average height, handsome after the fashion of the time, with a high forehead, chestnut eyes, and a wave of thick brown hair. A large mustache, carefully waxed until it tapered to points, offset the sharp slash of his Roman nose. He dressed better than most workingmen, wearing a suit, high collar, tie, and well&#x2014;soled shoes&#x2014;all signs of some prosperity. Exactly how he earned his money, though, was scarcely obvious. If asked, Madonia claimed to be a stonemason. But even a casual observer could see that this was a man unused to manual labor. His forty&#x2014;three&#x2014;year&#x2014;old body had begun to sag, and his soft hands&#x2014;neatly manicured&#x2014;bore no trace of an �artisan&#x2019;s calluses. &nbsp;<br><br> After a while the solitary diner, sated, thrust his bowl aside and glanced across the room to where a handful of companions lounged against one wall. Like him, they spoke Sicilian&#x2014;a dialect so rich in words drawn from Spanish, Greek, and Arabic that it was scarcely intelligible, even to other Italians&#x2014;and, like his, the jewelry and the clothes they wore were quite at odds with their supposed professions: laborer, farmer, clothes presser. Yet there was no mistaking the fact that Madonia was an outsider here. Immigrants though all those in the restaurant were, the others had become New Yorkers and now felt quite at home amid the teeming streets of the Italian colony. Madonia, on the other hand, had first come to Manhattan just a week ago and did not know the city. He found it disconcerting that he required an escort to find his way round Little Italy. Worse, he was growing increasingly alarmed at the way these men he barely knew muttered together in low voices, and spoke so elliptically that he could not grasp the meaning of their words. &nbsp;<br><br> Madonia had little chance to grapple with this mystery. The Sicilian had barely finished his meal when, with a click that echoed loudly through the room, the solitary door into the restaurant swung open and a second group of men appeared. In the sickly flicker of the gaslight Madonia made out the face of one he knew: Tommaso Petto, an oval&#x2014;faced hulk of muscle and menace whose broad chest, strong arms, and limited intelligence had won him the nickname of &#x201c;the Ox.&#x201d; Behind him, another figure lurked, silhouetted momentarily against one wall of the saloon. It was that of a man of slender build and middling height, his eyes twin drops of jet, like black holes bored into his skull. The newcomer&#x2019;s face was expressionless and gaunt, his skin rough, his chin and cheeks unshaven. He wore his mustache ragged, like a �brigand&#x2019;s. &nbsp; <br><br>The Ox stepped instinctively aside, allowing the slight figure to step into the room. As he did so, a spasm of anxiety ran through the other figures in the restaurant. This was their leader, and they showed him fearful deference. Not one of the half&#x2014;dozen others present dared to return his gaze directly. &nbsp;<br><br> Madonia himself was not immune to the terror that the black&#x2014;eyed man inspired. The newcomer&#x2019;s voice, when he spoke, was parched, his gestures undemonstrative and minimal. Above all, there was the disconcerting way he swathed the right side of his body in a voluminous brown shawl. The arm that he kept hidden was, Madonia knew, appallingly deformed. The forearm itself was stunted, no more than half the length of any normal �man&#x2019;s. Worse still, its hand was nothing but a claw. It lacked, from birth, the thumb and first four of its fingers. Only the little finger, useless on its own, remained, like the cruel joke of some uncaring deity. Black eyes&#x2019; name was Giuseppe Morello, but his maimed appendage had earned him the nickname &#x201c;Clutch&#x201d; or &#x201c;the Clutch Hand.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br> Morello wasted little time on ceremony. A single gesture from his good left hand sufficed; two of the men who had been lounging along the wall jerked up and pinioned Madonia, each seizing an arm as they dragged the diner to his feet. Their prisoner struggled briefly but without effect; grasped none too gently by his wrists and shoulders, he had no chance of escape. To shout out was hopeless; the room was too far from the sidewalk for even a full&#x2014;blown scream of terror to be audible. Half standing, half supported by his captors, he writhed helplessly as the black&#x2014;eyed man approached. &nbsp; <br><br>Exactly what passed between Madonia and the Clutch Hand is uncertain. There may have been a brief but angry conversation. Most likely the word nemico, enemy, was used. Perhaps Madonia, aware, far too late, of the lethal danger he was in, begged uselessly for mercy. If so, his words had no effect. Another gesture from the black&#x2014;eyed man and the two associates restraining the prisoner dragged him swiftly across the floor toward the rusty sink. A rough hand seized Madonia by the hair, yanking his head back and exposing his throat. At this, a third man lunged forward wielding a stiletto&#x2014;a thin&#x2014;bladed dagger, honed to razor sharpness and some fourteen inches long. A �second&#x2019;s pause, to gauge angle and distance, and the blade was thrust home, sideways on, above the �Adam&#x2019;s apple. &nbsp;<br><br> The blow was struck with such brutal strength that it pierced �Madonia&#x2019;s windpipe from front to back and continued on till it struck bone. The men holding the captive felt his frame collapse, limbs rubbery and unresponsive, as the weapon was withdrawn. Using all their strength, they hauled the dying man back to his feet as Petto the Ox stepped up, his own knife in his hand. A single sweeping slash from left to right, so fierce it cut right through �Madonia&#x2019;s thick three-�ply linen collar, severed both throat and jugular vein, all but beheading the prisoner. &nbsp; <br><br> Shocking though this violence was, it was premeditated. As life left Madonia in gouts, the men gripping his arms forced his head over the sink so that each succeeding pulse of blood drummed against the iron and gurgled down into the drains. The little that escaped fell onto the �victim&#x2019;s clothes or was soaked up by the sawdust underfoot. None reached the floorboards to stain them and leave lasting evidence of the crime. &nbsp; <br><br> It took a minute, maybe more, for the awful flow of blood to ebb. As it did, thick fingers reached around �Madonia&#x2019;s gashed neck and tied a square of gunnysack around his throat. The coarse fabric absorbed the dying trickle from the wounds as the corpse was doubled, lifted bodily, and carried to the center of the room. There other hands had dragged a barrel, three feet high, of the sort supplied by wholesalers to New �York&#x2019;s stores. A layer of muck and sawdust, scooped up from the floor, had been spread inside to absorb any remaining blood, and the dead �man&#x2019;s body was forced inside with uncaring savagery. &nbsp; <br><br>One arm and a leg projected from the barrel, but that was immaterial; Morello and his men had no interest in concealing the body. �Madonia&#x2019;s corpse was meant to be discovered, and the savage wounds it bore were a deterrent. Still, there was no point in chancing premature detection. An old overcoat, its labels carefully removed, was spread over the protruding limbs and the barrel wrestled and maneuvered back into the saloon and thence through a door that opened onto an alley. A decrepit one-�horse covered wagon stood there, waiting in the darkness. Several of the Sicilians combined their strength and heaved their burden onto it; two men, hunched now in heavy cloaks, climbed on. And, with a creak of springs and clop of hooves, Benedetto Madonia embarked upon his final journey. &nbsp; <br><br>An hour or so later, shortly after dawn, a cleaning woman by the name of Frances Connors left her apartment on the East Side and set off to the nearest bakery to buy rolls. &nbsp; <br><br>Her neighborhood was desperately impoverished. �Connors&#x2019;s tenement stood between a failing livery stable, its business proclaimed in peeling paint, and a collapsing row of billboards buttressed with iron scrap. To her right, as she turned out of her apartment, the East River slopped a tide of stinking effluent against crumbling wharfs. To her left, a warehouse full of cackling poultry leaned hard against a facto...</p><h2>Non Non Biyori Vol. 7 (Non Non Biyori, 7)</h2><p><p><i>Non Non Biyori</i> is a delightfully charming, all-ages manga series that follows the miscellaneous adventures of a group of girls in the Japanese countryside.</p><p>Striking a balance between slapstick humor and heartfelt nostalgia, <i>Non Non Biyori</i> features both artwork that beautifully depicts nature, as well as adorable characterizations of its main characters.</p><p> Welcome to the countryside village of Asahigaoka, a quaint town far removed from the hustle-and-bustle of the big city.

Recognizing that Jesus Christ was the missionary sent by the Father, and that the Bible is the Magna Carta of missions, men like Henry Martyn, John G. Paton, John Eliot, David Brainerd and William Chalmers Burns left home, family and love for the sake of Christ and to spread his good news. The narratives of their monumental labours and sufferings and their strong longings to see Christ glorified in the salvation of the nations make awe-inspiring and God-honouring reading. Five Pioneer Missionaries tells the story of each of these servants of God. In doing so it not only outlines some of the great biblical principles of missions, but also challenges Christians today to live lives completely dedicated to serving Jesus Christ wherever he calls us to go.</p><p>Thornbury is a Southern Baptist Minister with a doctorate in Ministry, a BA and a Master&#39;s degree in Theology.

This book brings together newspaper articles about their needlework activities with quilts inscribed with hundreds of names - known as signature quilts. Quilting communities encompassed families, church groups, civic and social organizations, and varied awareness groups. Using their quiltmaking skills, women comforted both their families and those in need. They successfully raised monies for their villages and towns, for veterans and orphaned children, for worldwide organizations such as the Red Cross, and benevolent causes close to home. This nearly 200-year tradition in quiltmaking carries into the 21st Century. With needle and scroll, quiltmakers continue to capture their special family events, hails and farewells of friends and coworkers, and needful societal causes in the medium of cloth.</p><p></p><h2>The Needlework of Mary Queen of Scots</h2><p><p><b>A significant work in the history of costume and textiles, shedding new light on little known aspects of Mary Queen of Scots' life</b></p><p>Although a large body of needlework has always been attributed to Mary Queen of Scots, little attempt was made to authenticate these pieces or to explain how so energetic and impetuous a woman could have found pleasure in the meticulous craft of embroidery.&nbsp;This is the first comprehensive study of the Queen as a needlewoman, describing all the works associated with her. Every piece marked by her cipher or monogram is illustrated in full.

His best-known work, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 25 languages and sold over twelve million copies. Since the <b>Caterpillar</b> was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than sixty books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.<p>Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929, Eric Carle moved with his parents to Germany when he was six years old; he was educated there, and graduated from the prestigious art school, the Akademie der bildenden Kunste, in Stuttgart. But his dream was always to return to America, the land of his happiest childhood memories. So, in 1952, with a fine portfolio in hand and forty dollars in his pocket, he arrived in New York. Soon he found a job as a graphic designer in the promotion department of <i>The New York Times</i>. Later, he was the art director of an advertising agency for many years.</p><p>One day, respected educator and author, Bill Martin Jr, called to ask Carle to illustrate a story he had written. Martin's eye had been caught by a striking picture of a red lobster that Carle had created for an advertisement. <b>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</b> was the result of their collaboration. It is still a favorite with children everywhere. This was the beginning of Eric Carle's true career. Soon Carle was writing his own stories, too. His first wholly original book was <b>1,2,3 to the Zoo</b>, followed soon afterward by the celebrated classic, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>.</p><p>Eric Carle's art is distinctive and instantly recognizable. His art work is created in collage technique, using hand-painted papers, which he cuts and layers to form bright and cheerful images. Many of his books have an added dimension - die-cut pages, twinkling lights as in <b>The Very Lonely Firefly</b>, even the lifelike sound of a cricket's song as in <b>The Very Quiet Cricket</b> - giving them a playful quality: a toy that can be read, a book that can be touched. Children also enjoy working in collage and many send him pictures they have made themselves, inspired by his illustrations. He receives hundreds of letters each week from his young admirers. The secret of Eric Carle's books' appeal lies in his intuitive understanding of and respect for children, who sense in him instinctively someone who shares their most cherished thoughts and emotions.</p><p>The themes of his stories are usually drawn from his extensive knowledge and love of nature - an interest shared by most small children. Besides being beautiful and entertaining, his books always offer the child the opportunity to learn something about the world around them. It is his concern for children, for their feelings and their inquisitiveness, for their creativity and their intellectual growth that, in addition to his beautiful artwork, makes the reading of his books such a stimulating and lasting experience.</p><p>Carle says: "With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun."</p><p></p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Group (USA) Books for Young Readers.

It culminated in a terrifying moment in the early hours of 3 December 1967 when, in a cramped operating theatre in a Cape Town hospital, Professor Chris Barnard stared into an empty cavity from which he had just removed a heart. He knew that he had only minutes left to make history and save the life of a 55-year-old man by filling the gaping hole in his chest with a heart which had just been beating inside a 25-year-old woman. <i>Every Second Counts</i> is the story of Chris Barnard and his gripping race against four extraordinary men to conquer the greatest of medical challenges. It is also a deeply personal biography of a Casanova surgeon with film-starlooks, whose tortured private life was played out on the most public of stages.</p><p>Donald McRae is the award-winning author of eleven non-fiction books, which have featured sporting icons, legendary trial lawyers and heart surgeons. He has twice won the prestigious William Hill Sports Book of the Year, for <i>Dark Trade</i> and <i>In Black &amp; White</i>. He is a three-time&nbsp;Interviewer of the Year winner&nbsp;and has also won&nbsp;Sports Feature Writer of the Year on three separate occasions for his work in the <i>Guardian</i>. He lives in Hertfordshire.<i>Starred Review.</i> Although Christiaan Barnard (who died in 2001) is venerated as the first to successfully transplant a human heart, on December 3, 1967, McRae shows that he was only one of four heart surgeons who pioneered this miraculous specialty from 1958 through 1968. The South African Barnard hadn't toiled in research labs, but, according to McRae, appropriated the work of three Americans and, in a period of debate over whether to define death by the brain's or the heart's cessation, he took a beating heart from a brain-dead donor. McRae portrays Barnard as a rural Afrikaner with an inferiority complex, a "lothario" with a deeply troubled personal life and a publicity hound who delegated postoperative patient care to others as he hobnobbed with celebrities and the media. As McRae, an award-winning London-based sports writer (<i>Heroes Without a Country: America's Betrayal of Joe Louis and Jesse Owens</i>), demonstrates in this top-notch journalistic feat that elucidates complicated medical procedures, the Americans whom Barnard bested were medical giants. Norman Shumway in California and Richard Lower of Virginia were masters of transplant and rejection research, and New York's Adrian Kantrowitz would eventually develop the balloon pump that saved hundreds of thousands of lives. <i>(June 1) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Then, one day, he inadvertently witnesses an impossible event: the violent appearance of a 200-foot stone pillar in the forested interior. Its arrival collapses trees for a quarter mile around its base, freezing ice out of the air and emitting a burst of ionizing radiation. It appears to be composed of an exotic form of matter. And the inscription chiseled into it commemorates a military victory--sixteen years in the future.<br><br>Shortly afterwards, another, larger pillar arrives in the center of Bangkok-obliterating the city and killing thousands. Over the next several years, human society is transformed by these mysterious arrivals from, seemingly, our own near future.

Sworn to secrecy, he began revealing details of his wartime activities only in the last years of his life as he became afflicted with Alzheimer's. His exploits revealed a man of remarkable bravado -- posing as a Nazi guard, slipping behind enemy lines to blow up ammunition dumps, and being flown to one of the first concentration camps liberated by the Allies to report on the atrocities found there.<p><em>My Father's Secret War</em> is an intimate account of Franks coming to know her own father after years of estrangement. Looking back at letters he had written her mother in the early days of WWII, Franks glimpses a loving man full of warmth. But after the grimmest assignments of the war his tone shifts, settling into an all-too-familiar distance. Franks learns about him -- beyond the alcoholism and adultery -- and comes to know the man he once was.</p><p>Her story is haunting, and beautifully told, even as the tragedy becomes clear: Franks finally comes to know her father, but only as he is slipping further into his illness. Lucinda Franks understands her father as the disease claims him. <em>My Father's Secret War</em> is a triumph of love over secrets, and a tribute to the power of the connection of family.</p></p><p>Journalist Lucinda Franks won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971 for her national reporting. She has been writing for the <i>New York Times</i> since the mid-1970s, also contributing to <i>The New Yorker</i>, the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>Travel and Leisure</i>, <i>People</i>, and <i>New York</i> magazine, among others. Her novel, <i>Wild Apples</i>, was published in 1991. She is married to New York City district attorney Robert Morgenthau and has two children. She lives in New York City.Using vulgar language and lacking a strong theme or direction, Franks recounts her childhood memories, which include her fathers revealing stories of his secret military service during WWII. As Franks learns more of his past, she gains an understanding of his present. Joyce Bean takes a risk by reading as if to small children, using overacted theatrical voices for friends and relatives. The comical character created for the authors father has a distorted and scratchy voice, making him difficult to understand. The light treatment seems incompatible with his somber recollections of the Nazi death camps he helped liberate. Readers looking for serious history will be disappointed, but they may be entertained in their effort to find it.

As New, Impeccable copy - appears to be unread - of a fishing memoir by Australian art critic Robert Hughes</p><p>Robert Hughes's memoir of the fishing life begins like a lazy day on the water. A few observations on the sport's history, a look at the literature, even some comical reminiscences about trying to harpoon tuna and battle tarpon. But then Hughes returns to the piers of his native Sydney. It is there that the boy who would turn into the preeminent art critic of his generation began educating his eyes: "To fish at all, even on a humble level," he writes, "you must notice things: the movement of the water and its patterns, the rocks, the seaweed.... Time on the pier taught me to concentrate on the visual, for fishing is intensely visual, even--perhaps especially--when nothing is happening. It is easy to look, but learning to <i>see</i> is a more gradual business, and it sneaks up on you unconsciously, by stealth." <p> Hughes has made <i>seeing</i> his life's pursuit, and despite claims of mediocrity in angling, his grasp of the larger picture is clear. In this slim volume's concluding essay, "Troubled Waters," he decries the ravages of commercial fishing, reasserts our need to respect creatures unlike ourselves, and provides an emphatic reminder that fishing's real joys are in the catching--not the killing. "We have no moral right to preserve only cuddly tourist attractions like the koala," he stresses. "Wildness, otherness, and dread, embodied in living creatures, also have their claims." <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>"In some ways it's a ridiculous human passion," renowned author and art critic Robert Hughes confesses of his lifelong devotion to fishing. But it is a powerful, abiding passion nonetheless, one that Hughes shares with presidents and paupers, philosophers and truants, mystics and macho deep-sea warriors. Author of the acclaimed <b>The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia's Founding</b>, <b>The Culture of Complaint</b>, and <b>American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America</b>, Hughes now brings his wit, insight, critical eye, and incomparable genius for narrative to bear on the pastime he loves best.<br><br>Hughes acknowledges that if he were to amortize the market value of the fish he catches in a year against the expense of catching them, he'd be shelling out about $55 a pound on bluefish alone. But clearly he's not in it for the money. In <b>A Jerk on One End</b>, Hughes traces his love of fishing back to his earliest boyhood on Sydney Harbor, Australia, and recounts the high and low points of his career with rod and reel--the first surge of triumph when he snagged a six-pound bonito, the shame of having his father catch him trout-fishing with live bait (the most perfidious failing in the eyes of every fly-fisher), hair-raising shark tales he picked up on the Sydney waterfront.<br><br>Here too is a history of fishing going back to classical antiquity, along with meditations on the art and philosophy of fishing and deep draughts of the finest fishing writing through the ages. Hughes gazes long and hard into the shining eyes of his prey and captures the essence of each noble species in brilliant verbal portraits--the delicate striped bass, most amenable to cooking and most susceptible to urban pollutants; the infinitely treacherous tarpon; the fastidious, elusive trout; the giant bluefin tuna, which holds the dubious honor of being the most expensive and sought after animal on earth. And in one unforgettable passage, he adopts the fish's point of view and forces us to imagine the horror of being hooked and reeled into an alien element.<br><br>Fishing, Hughes asserts, taught him patience as a boy and reverence for nature as man. In the concluding pages of this splendid book, he draws on this reverence to make a powerfully reasoned plea for the ecology of the sea. Mixing memoir, history, adventure, folklore, and stunning descriptions of the fathomless mysteries of the deep, Robert Hughes has written an absolutely magnificent volume. <b>A Jerk on One End</b> is a superb piece of prose and a profound meditation on the beauty, the excitement, and the peerless pleasures of fishing--and of life.</p><h2>Jan Matulka: A catalogue of selections from the estate of Jan Matulka (1890-1972)</h2><p>A catalogue of selections from the estate of Jan Matulka (1890-1972). 116 numbered color illustrations.

Their work is best experienced through the senses. Tactility, expressed through an eloquence of craft, the use of textured materials, and the logical design of structural systems, gives their buildings a rightness within the landscape. In their hands, daylight becomes a building material. Small wall apertures, three-sided dormers, clerestories, and other details grab, bend, and thread sunlight from one end of their houses to the other. Full of light and atmosphere, the houses are the physical embodiment of the great Charles Moore's influential tenet that architecture is about enhancing a sense of place.<br><br><em>Natural Houses</em> presents seven of the Austin, Texas-based firm's exquisitely crafted projects. Precise and cool, with forms often derived from the American vernacular of barns and cottages, these are painstakingly crafted houses made from regionally appropriate and aesthetically timeless materials. <em>Natural Houses</em> presents a range of sites and residences&#x2014;from a small cabin in the woods to a multibuilding camp. Sited on a cliff, the House Above Lake Austin uses terraces to descend its steeply hilly site. The building's simple materials celebrate thesite and climate not by drawing attention to themselves, but by blending in. The stone foundation is similarly tied to the natural stone of the mountain. Smooth plaster walls above the stone foundation appear to have been chiseled from the rock itself. In a deceptively simple boathouse the walls fold down to become impromptu diving platforms.<br><br>Exceptional photography captures the light and atmosphere of each project setting and illustrates how the firm rigorously expresses the design concept through detailing and construction. An introduction by Rick Sundberg of Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen Architects and essays by Jen Renzi and Frederick Steiner chart the firm's evolution and influences.</p><p>Chris Wise previously worked at Lyndon/Buchanan Architects and at Moore/Andersson. He founded Andersson-Wise Architects with Arthur Andersson in 2001.<br><br>Arthur Andersson was a principal of Moore/Andersson Architects with Charles Moore.</p><h2>Princes of Ireland, Planters of Maryland: A Carroll Saga, 1500-1782 (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>Charles Carroll of Carrollton is most often remembered as the sole Roman Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence. In this monumental study of the Carrolls in Ireland and America, that act vindicates a family's determination to triumph without compromising lineage and faith.<br>Ronald Hoffman peels back layer after layer of Carroll family history, from dispossession in Ireland to prosperity and prominence in America. Driven to emigrate by England's devastating anti-Catholic policies, the first Carroll brought to Maryland an iron determination to reconstitute his family and fortune. He found instead an increasingly militant Protestant society that ultimately disenfranchised Catholics and threatened their wealth and property. Confronting religious antagonisms like those that had destroyed their Irish ancestors, this Carroll and his descendants founded a fortune--and a dynasty that risked everything by allying with the American Revolutionary cause.<br> Meeting each crisis with a tenacious will to survive and prevail, the Carrolls earned an esteemed place in the new nation. Hoffman balances private lives against their contentious public role in American history. The journey from Irish rebels to American revolutionaries shaped and shattered the Carrolls--and then remade them into one of the first families of the Republic. <br><br><br><br></p><p>"[The authors] present a compelling account not just of Charles the Signer but of the entire Carroll family. . . . Hoffman and Mason transform a family narrative whose moment of glory was a sectarian vignette in 1776 into fully realized scenes within a wider drama of religious strife, colonization, revolution, as well as tense relations across generations and between the sexes."-- <i>Journal of Southern History</i> <br>An intergenerational chronicle of the struggles and triumphs of the Carrolls, a prominent Irish Catholic family in Protestant Maryland. Charles Carroll (1737-1832) who represents the last of the three generations of patriarchs, is perhaps best known as the sole Roman Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence. Tracing the Carroll&#39;s history from Ireland to Maryland, this account offers a transatlantic perspective of Anglo-American colonialism and reveals the often overlooked discrimination that Roman Catholics faced in colonial America.</p><h2>Basher History: US Presidents: Oval Office All-Stars</h2><p><p>Basher History: US Presidents, Oval Office All-Stars created and illustrated by Simon Basher, written by Dan Green <br>Basher's US Presidents shows you the nation's leaders as you've never seen them before.

Profiles of the 44 &#x201c;Oval Office All-Stars&#x201d; each include a list of six facts, a two-paragraph first-person narrative, and a cartoon illustration with accompanying accoutrement that gives a clue to the president&#x2019;s story (the odder the better) and what he achieved. Readers might already know a lot of this, but Basher and Green serve it up in a hip, imaginative style and throw in some lesser-known facts, too. For example, James Monroe brought &#x201c;groovy vibes&#x201d; to the nation, and who knew that Jimmy Carter reported seeing a UFO? As usual, Basher&#x2019;s illustrations look like the same little round-headed doll accented with various facial hair, hairstyles, and period attire.

She lives in Michigan.Grandpa and his grandson, who narrates this story, drive a tractor through woods, cutting down evergreens for the Tree Hut, which will open after Thanksgiving. Most of the tree farm's customers cut their own trees, but some buy those off the lot. Everyone gets Grandma's cookies. Purmwell packs the friendly story with plenty of information. Tree farming is year-long work. The family plants the seedlings, trims and prunes, measures and tags. But on Christmas Eve, the Tree Hut closes, and the family gathers for an old-fashioned holiday--complete with tree trimming. The text makes the book interesting; the art gives it charm. The simply drawn, sometimes diminutive characters exude warmth and exemplify the work that goes into any kind of farming. Weber uses the evergreen motif to best advantage, dotting every spread with trees while still managing to show variety among the species. The barrage of green, mostly set against white snow, gives the book an irresistible freshness. Pair it with Sandra Jordan's photo-essay of the same name. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is used by hundreds of governmental agencies, organizations and businesses throughout North America.<b>Why This Guide is So Important</b><p>There is a growing Earth-friendly revolution taking hold: the desire to have more choice and control in the foods we consume. Food gardening at home, or in a community plot, is part of a broad shift in consciousness that focuses on wellness, nutrition and self-sufficiency. Personal or community food security allows households to provide more of their food needs and/or to share their harvest with others in need.</p><p>Home food gardening reacquaints us with optimally fresh, tasty and nutritious fruits and vegetables costing a fraction of store-bought produce that is often shipped long distances. It teaches children that fruits and vegetables come from the earth, not grown in grocery stores. It inspires us to be healthwise: to remember that we are what we eat. Importantly, food gardening can save us hundreds of dollars a year in food expenses.</p><p><b>The Old Model</b><br>Food policy today is primarily based on creating a dependent <i>consumer</i> whose needs are determined by government, large corporations, agribusinesses, politics, and media marketing. As a result, home food production and preservation in the U.S. has declined from 35% of households in 1870 to only 1% in 2005. Additionally (and in spite of scientific advances), people suffer from diminished health and healthcare, poor air, water and soil quality, and overprocessed, nutrient-poor foods.</p><p>Perhaps most detrimental to individuals is the loss of a heartfelt and informed connection to this Earth: its soil, water, air, habitat and species. Earth s natural resources are too often associated with commodities. As a result, people forget to live simply so that others, and this Earth, may simply live. They misplace the spirit of stewardship and generosity.</p><p><b>The New Model</b><br>The basic foundation of a new food policy restores informed choice as a <i>prosumer</i>: one who is empowered in their lifestyle habits and needs to be part of a broader solution to respect Earth s resources, to live within one s means, to commit to personal wellness, and to help others in need. It also brings the focus of food sufficiency to the local level: one s household, neighborhood and community. It supports local/regional family-based agriculture. Most importantly, a new food policy model restores personal confidence in knowing that we have a voice - personally, locally, nationally - in the well-being of our lives, the lives of others, and this Earth and all its resources and species.</p><p><b>This Book: One Small Step</b><br>It is our commitment, indeed, our hope, that this low-cost guide supports those initial steps to the jouney of a lifetime: not only to know the joy of co-creating with Nature, but to experience a new level of responsibility for your own health, nutritional, and food security needs.

To become whole beings again, we must reclaim our birthright as partners with all of creation. We achieve this by opening ourselves to the spirits of plants, animals, the elements, and Earth, making them our allies. These allies, known as devas, are energy beings through whom we can bridge the gap between the physical body and the energetic patterns that support all life. <br> <br><em>Partner Earth</em> teaches that we don&#x2019;t need any special psychic abilities to communicate with these beings of the natural world; we simply match frequencies with them, which means relaxing the mind and expanding the heart to receive more subtle signals.Through a process of remembering, our relationship with Earth can evolve into one of equal partnership. <em>Partner Earth</em> provides a wide range of practical exercises based on traditional wisdom, visualizations, and the author&#x2019;s long experience as an herbalist that enables one to learn this process, create sacred space, find plant and animal allies, and create flower essences that can help heal the rift between the individual and Nature. <br> <br>PAM MONTGOMERY is the Director of Green Terrestrial, an herbal product and educational business.

SHIPS SAME DAY WITH TRACKING NUMBER swhse</p><p>The Shakers have long been a misunderstood Christian sect. At the time of their arrival in America in 1774, they were persecuted as witches who spoke in tongues and participated in wild orgies; today they are known more for their handcrafted furniture than for their beliefs or history. While their name stems from their original practice of employing frenetic dancing as a way to invoke the spirit of God, the modern Shakers work toward an inner stillness through labor, simplicity of living, and prayer. Though often confused with both the Quakers and the Amish, with whom they share certain traits, the Shakers are unique in that all of their members are converts (they are bound to lifelong celibacy), they embrace technology when it allows them to work more efficiently, and while they have turned away from the values of modern society, they do not insulate themselves entirely from the outside world, particularly when it comes to working with other denominations for humanitarian causes. Though thousands joined the faith in the 19th century, today only eight Shakers remain, all of them working together on a farm in Sabbathday Lake, Maine. It was there that Suzanne Skees, a graduate of the Harvard Divinity School, spent a month living and working with the Shakers in an effort to understand and document their way of life. <p> Ostensibly a work of journalism, Skees's motive for writing <i>God Among the Shakers</i> was as much personal as professional: "I went to the Shakers to look for God, who lately had been absent from my harried, distracted days.... I was living the American dream. Striving to build a career, family, and home. Along the way, however, hope had been lost to frenzy, and my spirit had dried up...." It is this effort to analyze, if not remedy, her lapsed spirituality that provides the most insightful passages of the book. She views her immersion into their community as a personal test of faith, and the approach--along with extended quotations--results in a candid and colorful view of the Shakers that often reads like a series of intimate conversations. Skees successfully conveys the appeal of their approach to life while acknowledging the difficulties in achieving simplicity in an increasingly complex world. </p><p> Though her prose occasionally leans toward sentimentality, her firm grasp of the history and theology of the Shakers makes her book informative, but it is her honesty in detailing her own transformation that makes it rewarding. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Skees weaves together a popular history of Shakerism with an account of her month-long visit to Sabbathday Lake in Maine, the last living community of Shaker sisters and brethren. Skees, a journalist who writes on women's spirituality, studied comparative religion at Harvard Divinity Schoola kindly, open-minded institution whose intersecting currents of academic study, pastoral training, and spiritual probing amply prepared the author for her work. The chapters are structured around themes central to Shaker lifeincluding celibacy, God, communion with spirits, relation with the outside world, prospects for survivaland based on both research in the community's library and conversations with its eight permanent residents. Skees contrasts the intensities of Shakers past with the wise mellowness of Sabbathday's current members. There are instructive sections on Shaker dance, music, and ritual observance. Perhaps from a wish for heightened contrast, Skees presents herself, a married woman with three sons, as too grounded in worldliness and sex (``I loved men with abandon'') ever to take up the Shaker path. But the authorial persona, which tends toward exaggeration and sentimentality, intrudes on the discussion. ``Lusty phalluses and looming egos'' do not, pace Ms. Skees, define men of the world. Card cataloging, a task that the librarian, Sister June, performs, is not an ``ancient process.'' And people today do not use words like ``verily'' and ``elsetimes,'' as the author quaintly insists on doing occasionally in her own speech. Skees's surprise over the outward ordinariness of deeply religious people, and over the loss of self that sometimes occurs there, seems disingenuouswhat else, after all, had she been learning at Harvard Divinity School? The Shaker voices communicate over the author's annoying obtrusiveness so that despite herself her work fills a gap in the growing genre of reportage on the inner life of modern religious communities. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

(1979) Paperback</h2><p>Explains the workings of several types of home electrical-power generators and systems, covering such topics as water wheels, windmills, and solar energy</p><p></p><h2>The Dark Half</h2><p>Written by the author of &#34;Carrie&#34;, &#34;Salem&#39;s Lot&#34;, &#34;The shining&#34; and &#34;Christine&#34;, this novel features Thad Beaumont, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who has developed a lucrative thriller-writing alter ego named George Stark. He stops being fun so Beaumont wants to kill him.</p><p>In 1985, 39-year-old Stephen King announced in public that his pseudonymous alter ego, Richard Bachman, was dead. (Never mind that he revived him years later to write <i>The Regulators</i>.) At the beginning of <i>The Dark Half</i> (1989), 39-year-old writer Thad Beaumont announces in public that his own pseudonym, George Stark, is dead. <p> Now, King didn't want to jettison the Bachman novel, titled <i>Machine Dreams</i>, that was he working on. So he incorporated it in <i>The Dark Half</i> as the crime oeuvre of George Stark, whose recurring hero/alter ego is an evil character named Alexis Machine.</p><p> Thad Beaumont's pseudonym is not so docile as Stephen King's, though, and George Stark bursts forth into reality. At that point, two stories kick into gear: a mystery-detective story about the crime spree of George Stark (or is it Alexis Machine?) and a horror story about Beaumont's struggle to catch up with his doppelganger and kill him dead.</p><p> This is not the first time that Stephen King has written a dark allegory about the fiction writer's situation. As the <i>New York Times</i> writes, "<i>Misery</i> (1987) is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his audience, which holds him prisoner and dictates what he writes, on pain of death. <i>The Dark Half</i> is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his creative genius, the vampire within him, the part of him that only awakes to raise Cain when he writes, the fratricidal twin who occupies 'the womblike dungeon' of his imagination." <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the bestselling author of more than thirty books of which the most recent are THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS and his non-fiction book ON WRITING. He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, in Bangor, Maine.</p><h2>I Am Legend</h2><p>A lone human survivor in a world that is overrun by vampires, Robert Neville leads a desperate life in which he must barricade himself in his home every night and hunt down the starving undead by day</p><p>One of the most influential vampire novels of the 20th century, <i>I Am Legend</i> regularly appears on the "10 Best" lists of numerous critical studies of the horror genre. As Richard Matheson's third novel, it was first marketed as science fiction (for although written in 1954, the story takes place in a future 1976). A terrible plague has decimated the world, and those who were unfortunate enough to survive have been transformed into blood-thirsty creatures of the night. Except, that is, for Robert Neville. He alone appears to be immune to this disease, but the grim irony is that now he is the outsider. He is the legendary monster who must be destroyed because he is different from everyone else. Employing a stark, almost documentary style, Richard Matheson was one of the first writers to convince us that the undead can lurk in a local supermarket freezer as well as a remote Gothic castle. His influence on a generation of bestselling authors--including Stephen King and Dean Koontz--who first read him in their youth is, well, legendary. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Bitter Harvest: The Great Betrayal and the Dreadful Aftermath</h2><p>This book is the autobiography of Ian Smith, the last Prime Minister of Rhodesia.

Even the experienced player may not get it on first reading a given tune, but You can expect to enjoy the process of learning... [and experience] the joy of recreating a traditional tune, of making it your own. This is the teacher/ student pact in effect throughout this marvelous book, written for the literary as much as the musical connoisseur. Although no classical violin experience is needed, you will need to know how to hold the fiddle and bow, and be able to play at least simple tunes in the first position. Having the ability to read music will enable you to follow the bowing patterns and left-hand techniques which the author feels are crucial in grasping the playing style.</p><p>Born in the country near Stafford, England, Pete Cooper began playing the violin at the age of 9 and went on to study English at Belliol College, Oxford. He began his professional career as a fiddler and singer in 1978, performing in Britain, Europe, and the USA first with Appalachian dulcimer player, Holly Tannen, then with traditional singer, Peta Webb. Since the mid 1980s, Peter has concentrated his musical efforts on the study and teaching of folk fiddle styles. His first solo album, All Around the World (1990), released on his own label, Fiddling From Scratch, featured music from Ireland, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and the USA. His 1993 album, The Wounded Hussar, explores the rich diversity of the Irish tradition and includes many of the tunes in this book The Complete Irish Fiddle Player. Pete currently teaches in London and reviews for Musical Traditions and Folk Roots magazines. He has composed music for film and, in addition to solo gigs, performs with a group called Vivando whose 1995 release by the same name includes some of his own compositions.</p><h2>Superman&#39;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen by Jack Kirby</h2><p><b>Legendary comics creator Jack Kirby reinvented the superhero genre with his sprawling saga of the Fourth World--a bold storytelling vision that was decades ahead of its time.</b><br><br>In honor of this extraordinary talent's centennial, DC Comics is proud to re-present the groundbreaking work of the King of Comics in a brand-new series of trade paperback editions, collecting his classic DC titles in all their four-color glory! <br><br>Kirby debuted his larger-than-life epic in the pages of DC's beloved sidekick showcase, <i>Superman's Pal</i>, <i>Jimmy Olsen</i>--and the Man of Steel's world would never be the same!

As the most valued team in comics, Simon and Kirby went on to create titles and concepts including <i>Fighting American, Boy's Ranch</i> and the creation of the romance comics genre.

Drawing on exclusive photos and interviews with Royko&#x2019;s family and intimates, the book chronicles Royko&#x2019;s rise from a &#x201c;flat-above-a-tavern&#x201d; youth&#x2014;raised above a bar on Chicago&#x2019;s Polish northwest side&#x2014;to one of the best-known names in American journalism.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Readers will get the inside scoop on Royko&#x2019;s epic battles with Mayor Richard J. Daley and other politicians and his hilarious columns featuring &#x201c;Slats Grobnik.&#x201d; They&#x2019;ll also meet a softer, largely unknown, side of Royko, through the love letters he sent to his wife-to-be from an Air Force base in Washington State.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 100 photos&#x2014;many never before available to the public&#x2014;capture the man and his times. Millions of readers&#x2014;in 800 newspapers around the world&#x2014;followed Royko&#x2019;s work and life. In The World of Mike Royko&#x2014;he lives again.</p></p><p>Pull up a stool, tap a beer, and immerse yourself in the world of one of the twentieth century's most celebrated journalists. This abundantly illustrated biography is the first account of the colorful life of newspaperman Mike Royko, the Pulitzer prize-winning columnist who personified Chicago in all its rough-edged charm, yet whose talent was appreciated by readers around the world.<p>In columns for the Chicago Daily News, then the Chicago Sun-Times, and finally the Chicago Tribune, Royko's biting wit was syndicated in more than 600 newspapers, and he was courted and feared by national political figures. He was even the inspiration for the John Belushi role in the film Continental Divide. But Royko's beginnings could not have been more humble. Raised in a flat above a tavern on Chicago's Polish Northwest Side, Royko -- like the marvelous character he created in his columns, Slats Grobnik -- was a street-smart wiseguy, tending bar though barely a teen.</p><p>Drawing on exclusive photos, letters, and interviews with Royko's family and friends, author Doug Moe, himself a daily newspaper columnist, chronicles Royko's remarkable rise to prominence. Seemingly destined for jail or the morgue, the young Royko enlisted in the air force and found his calling after lying his way into a job on the base newspaper. The blunt humor that was his sword as a writer was evident early, but readers will also meet another Royko, a sensitive and often insecure man who wrote more than 100 letters home to the sweetheart he would later marry, who loved classical music as well as neighborhood bars, and who was devastated by his first wife's death but made the most of his second chance at marriage andfatherhood.</p><p>Royko honed his knowledge of Chicago politics as a reporter for the legendary City News Bureau before meeting the grueling challenge of a daily newspaper column. In 8,000 columns spanning thirty-four years, Royko's most frequent subject was Chicago's rambunctious politics. His book Boss, a best-selling expose on Mayor Richard J. Daley and his political machine, appeared in 1971. But Royko, who some said "wrote with his fists", also sparred with U.S. presidents, bureaucrats and stuffed shirts, Frank Sinatra, and proponents of political correctness and nouvelle cuisine. He also praised and celebrated barbecued ribs and Chicago softball, the fierce talent of Nelson Algren, the rich variety of Chicago's neighborhoods, and the quiet dignity of ordinary people up against it.</p><p>The millions of readers who have missed Royko since his death in 1997 are in for a rare treat, for in The World of Mike Royko he lives again.</p>Doug Moe writes a column six days a week for The Capital Times in Madison, Wisconsin.</p><h2>A Wider World: Portraits in an Adolescence</h2><p>The autobiography of an incredibly brave woman.</p><p>A sequel to Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood, Simon's memoir is as image-rich and revealing as her distinguished travel books about Paris, London, etc. The author vivifies the people who figured in her life as a teenager: a disapproving father she escaped by means of low-paying jobs during the Depression; her spunky mother, an advocate of women's rights; radical intellectuals who encouraged her love of the arts. There is a great deal about Simon's sexual relations and the amatory experiences of friends, and about lesbian professors during her years at Hunter College. There are details on the author's living with a man, an almost unheard of arrangement during the 1930s. For the most part, this is the story of an eager young woman trying on various personalities by affecting outre costumes and airs until she arrived, almost imperceptibly, at "a second birth, after a long, erratic labor" during adolescence. In the moving, frequently funny events frankly detailed, readers discover the self-described "bright fantasist and loonywanderer" and understand why she was not quite lost in the mature woman. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In A Wider World: Portraits in an Adolescence , Simon continues the autobiography she began in Bronx Primitive. Kate was a maverick; the daughter of Jewish immigrants in the Bronx in the 1930s, she rebelled against her overbearing father while still a young adolescent and virtually raised herself. She worked as a mother's helper for artistic Village families, summered at communistic summer colonies, explored Harlem, camped out with a boyfriend when she was 16. Through the wealth of experiences, Simon struggled to learn about herself trying on this and that image in vain adolescent posturing. An honest, dramatic picture of what it was like to be a certain adolescent at a certain place and time. Recommended.

Arrakis is the source of spice, a mind enhancing drug which makes interstellar travel possible, and therefore the most valuable substance in the galaxy. When Duke Atreides and his family take up court there, they fall into a trap set by his rival, Baron Harkonnen. The Duke is poisoned, but his wife and her son Paul escape to the vast and arid deserts of Arrakis, which have given it the name Dune. They join the Fremen, natives of the planet who have learnt to live in this harsh and complex ecosystem. But learning to survive is not enough - Paul&#39;s destiny was mapped out long ago and his mother is committed to seeing it fulfilled.</p><p>This Hugo and Nebula Award winner tells the sweeping tale of a desert planet called Arrakis, the focus of an intricate power struggle in a byzantine interstellar empire. Arrakis is the sole source of Melange, the "spice of spices." Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and longevity, so whoever controls it wields great influence. <p> The troubles begin when stewardship of Arrakis is transferred by the Emperor from the Harkonnen Noble House to House Atreides. The Harkonnens don't want to give up their privilege, though, and through sabotage and treachery they cast young Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet's harsh environment to die. There he falls in with the Fremen, a tribe of desert dwellers who become the basis of the army with which he will reclaim what's rightfully his. Paul Atreides, though, is far more than just a usurped duke. He might be the end product of a very long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human; he might be a messiah. His struggle is at the center of a nexus of powerful people and events, and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium. </p><p> <i>Dune</i> is one of the most famous science fiction novels ever written, and deservedly so.

Filled with grotesque creatures, murderous vampires, and an expected ending, the book contains &#34;a plot full of twists which leaves the reader hungry for more&#34; (J.K. Rowling).</p><p>Anyone who loves the humorous but hair-raising horror in R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series will devour British author Darren Shan's first novel with equal zeal. Some books are born with a surrounding buzz; this one even has Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling's stamp of approval: "Fast-paced and compelling, full of satisfying macabre touches," she writes. Warner Brothers will be making it into a movie, and the rest of the series is already in the works. Given all that, you'd expect a tour de force! Really, though, <i>Cirque Du Freak</i> is a thrill ride that will keep even the most reluctant readers turning pages, but will never take its place in the literary canon.<p> Darren Shan, author and narrator, sets the book up as a true story, warning readers: "Real life's nasty. It's cruel.... Evil often wins." Indeed, evil begins to win when Darren and his buddies find a flier for "Cirque Du Freak," a traveling freak show promising performances by the snake-boy, the wolf-man, and Larten Crepsley and his giant spider, Madame Octa. Darren and his friend Steve wouldn't miss it for the world.</p><p> So, Saturday night they sneak out to the old theater, tall and dark, with broken windows. "Every act you see tonight is real," croaks Mr. Tall. "Each performer is unique. And none are harmless." That's for sure. (A werewolf bites off the hand of someone in the audience, for instance.) Things grow very serious for the two boys when Steve not only recognizes Mr. Crepsley as a famous vampire, but professes his true desire to join him! To make matters worse, the spider-obsessed Darren goes back to the old theater to steal Madame Octa so he can teach her tricks in his room. (He does, with mixed results.) The plot further coagulates as Darren is faced with some terrible decisions about what to do to save his bloodthirsty friend Steve.</p><p> Readers may be too enthralled to notice some clumsy editing (the aforementioned bitten-off hand is later referred to as an arm, Darren stops dead in his tracks when he's already stopped, etc.). They may also not notice that the boys constantly use adult-sounding expressions like "his breath stank to the high heavens," though the book is clearly set in the 21st century. If this book gets under your kids' skin (and it probably will), they're in luck--we haven't heard the last of the Saga of Darren Shan.

Within the walls of the Seville are stories of love, new life, and death, of facing the ugly truth of who one has been and the beautiful truth of who one can become. </p><p>Sometimes taking a risk is the only way to move forward with our lives. As Ian the goldfish knows, "An entire life devoted to a fishbowl will make one die an old fish with not one adventure had."</p><p>In the tradition of Garth Stein's <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i> and Armistead Maupin's <i>Tales of the City</i>, Bradley Somer's<i> Fishbowl</i> is at turns funny and heartbreaking.</p></p><p><p>BRADLEY SOMER was born in Sydney, Australia and grew up in Canada and holds degrees in Anthropology and Archaeology.

Bradley currently lives in a little old house in the city of Calgary, Canada, where he works on his writing projects and tries to ignore the wild growth that his backyard has become.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Fishbowl</i> is a marvelous portrayal of the tentative - and often funny - ways human beings muddle about trying to connect with one another.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Toronto Star</i></p><p>&#x201c;Enjoyable touches of farce and wry asides abound, underscoring moments of reckoning in eccentric, yet deeply human, dilemmas.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;For all their eccentricities, these characters are united by a sense of desperation. . .

Some audiences have viewed Gabler as a woman driven to desperation simply because her world has turned out to be less charmed than she hoped. For others, she is a victim of her times, unwilling to devote herself, as was expected of her, to the duties of home. Jon Robin Baitz has brushed away the cobwebs, and he serves as an ambassador from Ibsen&#39;s age to our own, preserving the intensity of the original but translating it into a spare, contemporary idiom. His adaptation provides an opportunity to understand the play through a lens shaped by feminism and a theatrical tradition beginning with Beckett. Trapped by the conventions of her age, Gabler is both a martyr and a female incarnation of Vladimir and Estragon, longing for a salvation that will likely never arrive.</p><p><p>One of George Bernard Shaw's best-known plays, <i>Pygmalion</i> was a rousing success on the London and New York stages, an entertaining motion picture and a great hit with its musical version, <i>My Fair Lady</i>.

In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.<br>The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw's brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made <i>Pygmalion</i> one of the most popular comedies in the English language.</p><p></p>One of Shaw's most enduring works, Pygmalion is an insightful comedy of class relations and perceptions, as played out between a Cockney flower girl and the irascible speech professor who has taken her on as a pet project.

Set in 1793, in the full glare of the Enlightenment, the novel uses the stuff of dreams and fairy tales to reject mechanistic rationalism. When three BelgiansAIngmar de Neville, decadent prince and magician; impoverished sculptor Albert Dupr?; and tubby, ostentatious merchant Alphonse NodierAventure to Naples, each is smitten by a wealthy glovemaker's austere, inscrutable 16-year-old daughter, Elmina Civile. When Elmina's pet linnet starves to death through her forgetfulness, she tosses the dead bird to the gardener's catAa seemingly callous act that repulses her suitors but does not prevent Dupr? from asking for, and getting, her hand in marriage. As Elmina metamorphoses from cold-blooded scatterbrain to siren to angelic presence, Prince Ingmar, obsessively in love and gifted with clairvoyance, discovers that she is bewitched. Indifferent toward Sasa, her daughter by the now-insane Dupr?, Elmina lavishes attention on her informally adopted son, Geronte, a half-witted cripple who wears a filthy hen's feather stuck to his head. The boy may actually be a manifestation of a goblin, the Elf of CologneAwho has been around since 1505 and will die when he reaches age 300 because of a curse. Though elegantly translated, Ortese's (The Iguana) ornate, convoluted sentences and multiple conflicting versions of the same event may try readers' patience. However, as a threnody for the death of kindness and mystery in the modern worldAand of course for the linnetAthis luxurious and fevered novel hits a perfect, bittersweet note. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Women Find A Way: The Movement and Stories of Roman Catholic Womenpriests</h2><p>Meet Roman Catholic Womenpriests who are shaping a more inclusive, Christ-centered, Spirit-empowered Church of equals in the twenty-first century.

How lost was the Lost Generation? In this major reinterpretation of one of the most colorful decades in American history, Roderick Nash finds the image of the period to be less than life-size. His book is not only a summary of the high points of American thought from the Great War to the Great Depression but a lively foray into popular culture. His interest in Zane Grey as well as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry Ford as well as John Dewey, offers fresh insights into a decade filled with paradoxes. Seeking to find &#x201c;what captured the enthusiasm of ordinary people,&#x201d; Mr. Nash has written an original and persuasive analysis of a generation that continues to command our attention.</p><p>Roderick Nash is Professor of History and Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

In this book, novelist and critic Colm T�ib�n joins art historian Marc Simpson and Declan Kiely of The Morgan Library &amp; Museum to reveal how essential the language and imagery of the arts&#x2014;and friendships with artists&#x2014;were to James&#x2019;s writing.</p><p>The authors consider the paintings, photographs, drawings, and sculpture produced by artists in James&#x2019;s circle, assess how his pictorial aesthetic developed, and discuss why he destroyed so many personal documents and what became of those that survived. In examining works by figures such as John La Farge, Hendrik Andersen, and John Singer Sargent alongside selections from James&#x2019;s novels, personal letters, and travel writings, T�ib�n, Simpson, and Kiely explore the novelist&#x2019;s artistic and social milieu. They show him to be a writer with a painterly eye for colors and textures, shapes and tastes, and for the blending of physical and psychological impressions. In many cases, the characters populating James&#x2019;s fiction are ciphers for his artist friends, whose demeanors and experiences inspired James to immortalize them on the page. He also wrote critically about art, most notably about the work of his friend Sargent.</p><p>A refreshing new perspective on a master novelist who was greatly nourished by his friendships with artists, <i>Henry James and American Painting</i> reveals a James whose literary imagination, in T�ib�n&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;seemed most at ease with the image&#x201d; and the work of creating fully realized portraits of his characters.</p></p><p><p>Colm T�ib�n is the author of nine novels, including <i>The Master</i>, <i>Brooklyn</i> and, most recently, <i>House of Names</i>.

Unfortunately, the sweater was too small, and so, after it languished in the bottom of a dresser drawer for a year or more, she finally packed it in a paper grocers bag with a few other discarded items of clothing and toted it off to Goodwill. </p> <p> I don't think I would have heard the story of the sweater had I myself not learned to knit, some thirty years later. When my mother first told me about it. I was shocked that she had given the sweater away. The very idea brought to mind a flood of questions. Did the sweater still exist? Where was the sweater and who had worn it over the years? And, perhaps most importantly, could I have sworn it at some point? How many more sweaters would there have been had mom continued to knit? </p> <p> A year ago last Thanksgiving, I taught my mother to knit... again. The two of us toured local yarn shops one overcast Friday afternoon in search of the perfect project, needles, and yarn for her to begin. We found a simple but fun scarf pattern that called for a funky variegated yarn to be knit lengthwise on a circular needle. She selected a couple of skeins in shades of blue, greens, and gray, and we headed home. She boiled water for wild raspberry tea before we sat down in the living room where I taught her to cast on and then showed her the knit stitch. </p> <p> The going was awkward at first, but by Sunday evening she had completed her first scarf, dropping only a few stitches along the way. I was impressed with her progress. Over the months that followed, she knit several scarves, each one better than the last. She's since expanded her repertoire, knitting a sweater ("It looks store-bought!" my husband exclaimed) for herself and an adorable cap and sweater set for my son Will. </p> <p> For each of us. knitting has become more than a craft to occupy our time during long car rides or while watching TV in the evenings. Knitting has become something my mom and I share. These days, when we talk on the phone each week, we ask each other about our knitting projects. We exchange ideas, give each other knitting books as gifts, and work through rough spots together. </p> <p> In a way, our knitting relationship is a microcosm for the larger knitting community. No, I can't physically gather with knitters from around the country to knit and chat as I do with my mom or members of my knitting club. But I can collect the essays of knitters from all over North America into this book for knitters everywhere to read, relate to, and share with others. </p> <p> The essays in this collection range from shearing sheep on a Sunday afternoon in March to an evening in Sant'Arsenio, Italy, where women gather on their doorsteps to knit, crochet, embroider, and chat. Other essays delve into the psyche of the knitter -- What is it that makes us want to collect skein after skein of yarn that we may never use? Why do use find those romantic scenes depicted in pattern books so entrancing? Why is it that the appetite for new knitting projects always seems so much greater than what we can actually achieve in a lifetime? -- and, because crochet has become increasingly popular among knitters over the past few years, you'l1 find a few essays by those who've become hooked on crochet. I hope you enjoy them all. </p></p><h2>Turtle Watch</h2><p><p>People think Jiro-San is mad - he sits on the beach for hours, just listening to the wind and waiting, always waiting.

Inside the walls of Polo Ralph Lauren, though, he was long seen by some as a narcissist, an insecure ditherer, and, at times, a rampaging tyrant. </p><p>Michael Gross, author of the bestsellers <em>Model </em>and <em>740 Park</em>, lays bare the truths of this fashion emperor's rise, and reveals not only the secrets of his meteoric success in marketing our shared fantasies, but also a widely unknown side that's behind the designer&#x2019;s chic fa�ade.</p></p><p><p>Everyone knows the name Ralph Lauren. Many people know that he was born Ralphie Lifshitz. But not even Lauren himself knows the extra-ordinary history of his ancestry. And until now, no one really knew how this pint-size nebbish rose from the Jewish ghetto of the Bronx and turned himself from a yarmulke-topped yeshiva boy into the world's leading purveyor of old-money-WASP style. Genuine Authentic is that story.</p> <p>Horatio Alger, step aside. Lauren, the descendant of generations of eastern European rabbis, is the embodiment of modern ambition. He stands as a symbol of the awesome rewards of self-invention -- and not just because he turned a talent for designing ties into a ten-billion-dollar international business. He also demonstrates how precarious success is, how hard a road life can be even for the driven. </p> <p>Lauren is considered by many to be a phony and a copycat. Yet even though he made up his name and nearly went bankrupt trying to live up to it, he can't be dismissed as a mere fake. His products have revolutionized the way almost everything is sold and the way great brands are built. Like Henry Ford and Walt Disney, he's also a real American authentic. And his business is a stunning American success. </p> <p> There are at least two Ralph Laurens. To the public he's a gentle, modest, yet secure and purposeful man. Inside the walls of Polo Ralph Lauren, though, he's seen by some as a narcissist, an insecure ditherer, and at times a rampaging tyrant. </p><p> Michael Gross, author of the bestseller Model, lays bare the truths of this fashion emperor's rise, and reveals not only the secrets of his stunning success in marketing our shared fantasies but also the darker side that's hidden behind the shiny patrician image. </p> <p> Gross uncovers the essence of Lauren's carefully cultivated mystique: how he has turned his back on his own surprisingly aristocratic heritage to embrace another, more commercially viable, one; how he's built an image of luxury and wealth on a foundation of almost anonymous commodities, basic items of clothing like polo shirts and khaki pants, sold mostly in low-priced outlets, and seen everywhere from the subway to the world stage. </p><p>It wasn't easy. Along the way, Lauren conquered self-doubt and survived business reverses, even several brushes with bankruptcy. Genuine Authentic follows Lauren through an unhappy childhood and confused adolescence -- torn between an immigrant culture and his material desires -- to fame as a gray-haired thirty-something, and, finally, to the man he is today.</p><p> In recent years, after surviving brain tumor surgery, Lauren suffered from a massive midlife crisis, finding solace with a beautiful blond model. He survived that, too, and in the nineties took his company public, making him a billionaire but creating a whole new set of challenges to confront, new horizons to conquer, starting with Wall Street, and then on to the rest of the world. </p> <p>Phony?

Yet if we understand how they approached their task, and their assumption of God's immanence in the world, much that they wrote becomes clear. Many of them were men of high intelligence whose interpretation of events sheds clear light on what happened. Christopher Given-Wilson is one of the leading authorities on medieval English historical writing. He examines how medieval writers such as Ranulf Higden and Adam Usk treated chronology and geography, politics and warfare, heroes and villains. He looks at the ways in which chronicles were used during the middle ages, and at how the writing of history changed between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.<br></p><p><b>Chris Given-Wilson</b> is the editor of <i>The Chronicles of Adam Usk</i>.<br></p><h2>The Sweet Dove Died</h2><p><p>Between the amorous antique dealer Humphrey and his good-looking nephew James glides the magnificent Leonora, delicate as porcelain, cool as ice.

She died in 1980.</p>Novelist Barbara Pym&#39;s deft touch with the nuances of personality and social class in England in the 1970&#39;s is enhanced by Sheila Hancock&#39;s skillful reading. Her evocative characterizations bring a rich fullness to the quiet story of Lenore, a beautiful but aging woman competing for the affections of James, a man almost half her age. She manages to vanquish his young girlfriend but has more difficulty with a young American male lover. She also must cope with James&#39;s uncle, who is pursuing her. Hancock reflects Pym&#39;s sympathy for the confusion and loneliness of the characters but also catches the humor in the author&#39;s razor-sharp depictions of their follies. T.R.

People watched helplessly as their life savings disappeared and their loved ones starved.&nbsp;Germany&#x2019;s finances descended into chaos, with severe social unrest in its wake.</p><p>Money may no longer be physically printed and distributed in the voluminous quantities of 1923.&nbsp;However, &#x201c;quantitative easing,&#x201d; that modern euphemism for surreptitious deficit financing in an electronic era, can no less become an assault on monetary discipline.&nbsp;Whatever the reason for a country&#x2019;s deficit&#x2014;necessity or profligacy, unwillingness to tax or blindness to expenditure&#x2014;it is beguiling to suppose that if the day of reckoning is postponed economic recovery will come in time to prevent higher unemployment or deeper recession.&nbsp;What if it does not?&nbsp;Germany in 1923 provides a vivid, compelling, sobering moral tale.</p></p><p><p><i><b>Daily Express</b></i><b> (London)</b><br> &#x201c;Engrossing and sobering.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Allen Mattich, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, October 1, 2010</b><br> &#x201c;One of the most blood chilling economics books I&#x2019;ve ever read.&#x201d;</p><p><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i>, January 30, 2011</b><br> &#x201c;Every body ought to read this book.

In the art of coaxing courses from the landscape, his was the most sought-after signature through the first four decades of the 20th century. The finest of the classic course architects, he had definite ideas of how the game should be played--hence the title of this stunning photographic tribute--and he shaped his designs accordingly. His design philosophy stressed using what nature provided rather than a wholesale remolding of topography, and the game he sought to promulgate stressed strategy over power, enjoyment over penance. His output was prolific, and the masterpieces he shaped from nature were exceptional: Pinehurst, Seminole, Inverness, Oak Hill, and Congressional.<p> In <i>Golf, As It Was Meant to Be Played</i>, Michael Fay, the cofounder of the Donald Ross Society, attempts to create the perfect coffee-table Ross tribute by creating the perfect Ross course. His plan mixes and matches 18 different Ross venues to form a single, magnificent, virtual round that any serious player should salivate over. Teeing off at Aronomink Golf Club near Philadelphia and finishing up at Hartford Golf Club in Connecticut, Fay links together 18 strategically challenging and visually arresting holes built from 1907 to 1936. Not necessarily Ross's best holes, they all still play as Ross conceived them; Fay's aim was clearly to celebrate the unadulterated, living, still-relevant Ross rather than some golfing museum piece. To that end, both his knowledgeable text and Paul Rocheleau's evocative photographs blend into a wonderful golfing keepsake that easily obliterates par. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><b>Michael J.

In this unique history, Thierry Lenain examines the genealogy of faking and interrogates the anxious, often neurotic, reactions triggered in the modern art world by these clever frauds.&nbsp;Lenain begins his history in the Middle Ages, when the issue of false relics and miracles often arose. But during this time, if a relic gave rise to a cult, it would be considered as genuine even if it obviously had been forged. In the Renaissance, forgery was initially hailed as a true artistic feat. Even Michelangelo, the most revered artist of the time, copied drawings by other masters, many of which were lent to him by unsuspecting collectors. Michelangelo would keep the originals himself and return the copies in their place. As Lenain shows, authenticity, as we think of it, is a purely modern concept. And the recent innovations in scientific attribution, archaeology, graphology, medical science, and criminology have all contributed to making forgery more detectable&#x2014;and thus more compelling and essential to detect. He also analyzes the work of master forgers like Eric Hebborn, Thomas Keating, and Han van Meegeren in order to describe how pieces baffled the art world.&nbsp;Ultimately, Lenain argues that the science of accurately deciphering an individual artist&#x2019;s unique characteristics has reached a level of forensic sophistication matched only by the forger&#x2019;s skill and the art world&#x2019;s paranoia.<p></p></p><p><b>Thierry Lenain</b> is professor of art theory at the Universit� Libre de Bruxelles. He is the author of <i>Monkey Painting</i>, also published by Reaktion Books.&#39;since authorship is a major financial issue you need specialist advice. Enter the first character of Art Forgery: the art connoisseur. His claim is that it is impossible to forge a work of art; no forger, however skilled, can reproduce perfectly the Unique. The forger&#39;s aim is to prove him wrong. The epic struggle between the two constitutes the subject of Thierry Lenain&#39;s remarkable book, whose dazzling erudition and lucid logic make it a pleasure to read.&#39;- -- Donald Sassoon History Today &#39;This book delves into the history of art forgery, beginning with its prevalence in the middle ages, through the Renaissance to the present day. This genealogy of faking also examines the output and skill of some of the master forgers alongside the art world&#39;s thorny relationship with counterfeit work and the ever-more sophisticated technology for detecting fakes.&#39; - Apollo &#39;Lenain&#39;s fascinating book charts our changing attitudes to forgery, from the unbridled admiration of the skill of the well-rewarded copyist during the Renaissance to the hysterical over-reaction and condemnation of today&#39;s demonised so-called &#34;master forgers&#34; ... full of historical detail and philosophical explication on the nature of truth and reality applied to the art world.&#39; - ARLIS News</p><h2>I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie</h2><p>I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie is a collection of more than 200 of Ebert&#39;s most biting and entertaining reviews of films receiving a mere star or less from the only film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize.

Enlisting the help of her reporter friend J.D., McCone learns that the magazine is failing, despite the millions in venture capital that's supposedly financing it. The mystery deepens when she retrieves deleted files from Roger's computer suggesting that he knew who was sabotaging the magazine and shared that information, which he characterized as "insurance," with Jody Houston, a close friend, before he jumped off the Bay Bridge. Tracking Houston to an isolated cabin on the Oregon coast, McCone stumbles over the dead body of her friend J.D., and then finds herself framed for his murder. By the time she uncovers the truth about Roger's suicide and unmasks J.D.'s killer, she's confronted her remorse over Joey's death and put a painful part of her own past behind her. As usual, Muller turns in a solidly plotted, well-paced mystery with a heroine who grows in self-awareness and complexity with every new adventure. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Marcia Muller has written many novels and short stories.

Joan of Arc is one of the most famous women in history: a French folk legend, a Catholic saint, and a military heroine. Yet almost nothing is truly known about the Maid of Orleans besides her ultimate fate, being burned at the stake when she was still a teenager. The Hundred Years War between France and England was one of the great wars of the feudal ages, a conflict literally spanning a century in which an untold number of men on each side died. That makes it all more amazing that a teenaged peasant girl came to the front lines. Claiming God instructed her to save France from England, she convinced the uncrowned Charles to send her to the siege of Orleans, and she subsequently led the French army to a string of important victories that made it possible for Charles VII to be coronated as the King of France. Joan then exited the stage almost as quickly as she entered it, being captured by the Burgundians and handed over to the English to be put to death for heresy. Over the centuries, the memory of Joan of Arc has been firmly embedded in French lore, where she is still constantly invoked, and she remains a staple of world history and pop culture. While she is constantly portrayed in film and art, scholars debate the accuracy of historical accounts about her, and her legend and mythology hang above all of it.</p><p>Andrew Lang (March, 31, 1844 July 20, 1912) was a Scottish writer and literary critic who is best known as a collector of folk and fairy tales. Lang s academic interests extended beyond the literary and he was a noted contributor to the fields of anthropology, folklore, psychical research, history, and classic scholarship, as well as the inspiration for the University of St. Andrew s Andrew Lang Lectures. A prolific author, Lang published more than 100 works during his career, including twelve fairy books, in which he compiled folk and fairy tales from around the world. Lang s Lilac Fairy and Red Fairy books are credited with influencing J. R. R.

These were the propeller-driven, steel-hulled leviathans of legend, owned and operated by such famous shipping lines as North German Lloyd, White Star, Cunard, Guion, Red Star, Inman, and Hamburg-American. Photos of nearly 900 ships are arranged here in alphabetical order, and each ship is further identified by date, shipping line, and source. For genealogists the photographs represent a visual testimony of the great passenger ships that grew old in service and then passed from the scene without a trace.

It has remarkably little to do with the challenge of the trek itself: Colin Fletcher could make any stroll fascinating. Hanuse was 53 when she walked across the country (her husband accompanied her with a well-equipped RV). Her book is cluttered with diversions of her dog's antics along the way. Outside of admiring her pluck, there is little here for the reader. Meegan, a young Englishman, walked 19,000 miles from the tip of South America to the top of Alaska. Yet that isn't what makes his a better book. Instead it is Meegan's engaging style, his lack of braggadocio, and his amazing capacity to shrug off unpleasantness that makes his book enjoyable to read. It is of little consequence that this is the longest recorded journey. His trip took seven years, with several interruptions, during which he managed to start a family.

Designed in response to petrol shortages in the late 1950s, it was introduced in 1959 in both Austin and Morris guises, with either basic or De Luxe trim levels. Success came swiftly, and before long its makers at BMC were introducing van, pick-up and estate versions, high-performance Mini Coopers, and higher equipment levels on the Mini Super. Right through the 1960s, the success story continued, and the original formula proved so right that the updated Mk II models of 1967 were instantly recognisable as versions of the original and much-loved car. These early Minis are as much admired and sought-after today as ever, offering their own unique blend of nimble driving pleasure with readily affordable running costs. They are also increasingly the subject of detailed, part-number-perfect restorations, and this book is designed to help all those who aim to restore one of these early British-built Minis to their correct specification. Within these pages, respected classic car historian James Taylor gives each major model of Mini its own section. These sections provide full details of specifications and examine individual areas of each model in depth. They are backed up by colour photography of outstanding examples that illustrate the way these cars looked when they were new. Body panels, external trim and badging, paint colours, interior trim, dashboard, instruments and controls, under-bonnet components, engine and transmission, lights -- all this and more is comprehensively covered for both Mk I and Mk II Minis. For rapid reference to vital information, this formula has proved to be the most useful one for restorers. With more than 300 specially commissioned colour photographs, Factory-Original Mini will delight and enthral the restorer and the more casual Mini enthusiast alike.</p></p><p><p>After graduating from Oxford and pursuing further academic studies at Reading, <b>James Taylor</b> spent 12 years working in central government. However, the lure of writing about cars &#x2013; which he was doing in his spare time &#x2013; proved too great and he decided to turn it into a career. James has now written well over 100 books in all, and among them have been several definitive one-make or one-model titles. He has written for enthusiast magazines in several countries, has translated books from foreign languages, and even delivers effective writing training in both the public and private sectors. He spent the best part of ten years as the editor of <i>Land Rover Enthusiast</i> magazine and has always counted the products of the old Rover Company and of Land Rover as his favourite subject.

She now lives in Cambridge, England, where she is studying printmaking.</p>PreS&#x2014;This visually arresting, easy picture book is a surprisingly powerful masterpiece of design. Laid out entirely on electric orange pages, the two-color scheme hearkens back to a bygone era in children's book publishing. Far from being dated or dull, though, Kohara's elegant achievement retains an oh-so-contemporary flair thanks to savvy layout techniques. The story is delightfully simple: a little witch moves into a haunted house, and, fortunately for her, she knows exactly what to do with a house full of ghosts. First she traps them, then she washes them, and finally she repurposes them as useful items, such as curtains, table linens, and bedding. The story ends happily, with smiling ghosts performing new jobs all over her house. The ghosts have the opacity of used dryer sheets and trick the eye into thinking there are two textures on the page; this unique optical illusion is so convincing that readers may find themselves compelled to reach out and touch them. The dense orange that saturates each page casts the whole book in a rich, warm twilight. Toddlers and preschoolers are sure to enjoy this engaging read. With its subzero fear factor, fun narrative, and artful illustrations, it's a surefire Halloween hit.&#x2014;<i>Catherine Threadgill, Charleston County Public Library, SC</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This publication is divided into three parts: the first reproduces photo documentation of the original exhibit, the second compiles essays and interviews on Celant&#x2019;s project and the third includes the installation views of the show in Venice.

Winner of the Prix M�dicis for nonfiction, The Consolations of the Forest is a Thoreau-esque quest to find solace, taken to the extreme. No stranger to inhospitable places, Sylvain Tesson exiles himself to a wooden cabin on Siberia&#x2019;s Lake Baikal, a full day&#x2019;s hike from any "neighbor," with his thoughts, his books, a couple of dogs, and many bottles of vodka for company. Writing from February to July, he shares his deep appreciation for the harsh but beautiful land, the resilient men and women who populate it, and the bizarre and tragic history that has given Siberia an almost mythological place in the imagination. Rich with observation, introspection, and the good humor necessary to laugh at his own folly, Tesson&#x2019;s memoir is about the ultimate freedom of owning your own time. Only in the hands of a gifted storyteller can an experiment in isolation become an exceptional adventure accessible to all. By recording his impressions in the face of silence, his struggles in a hostile environment, his hopes, doubts, and moments of pure joy in communion with nature, Tesson makes a decidedly out-of-the-ordinary experience relatable. The awe and joy are contagious, and one comes away with the comforting knowledge that "as long as there is a cabin deep in the woods, nothing is completely lost."</p><p>Sylvain Tesson is a writer, journalist, and celebrated traveler. He has been exploring Central Asia&#x2014;on foot, bicycle, and horse&#x2014;since 1997. A best-seller in his native France, he is published all over the world&#x2014;and now in the United States.&#x201c;...wry, exuberant and a perfect balm for anyone who dreams of running away to the middle of nowhere.&#x201d; ~<i>San Francisco Chronicle<br><br></i>"One of the best fall travel&nbsp;books"<i> ~National Geographic<br></i><br>"[One of] the best books of the year." ~<i>Financial Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Like vodka thrown into a burning wood stove, this book blazes dangerously, beautifully, illuminating its subjects with mischievous flames of lyricism and wit. Brilliant and unforgettable.&#x201d;&nbsp;~David George Haskell, Professor of Biology at The University of the South, author of <i>The Forest Unseen: A Year&#x2019;s Watch In Nature</i>, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize<br><br>"This book is to be savored word by word. It is the diary of a man who spent six months by himself in a cabin on a Siberian lake. It contains beautiful and very evocative descriptions on the landscape, on solitude, on life, and on his numerous readings." ~<i>Words and Peace<br><br>"</i>Holiday Catalog/Staff Pick: If you fantasize regularly about moving alone to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, <i>Consolations of the Forest </i>might just be for you. Light-footed, insightful, diversionary, wry and delightfully unpretentious (no transcendentalism here), Tesson&#x2019;s book is the document of a vodka-fueled six-month solitude binge on the frozen edge of the deepest lake in the world." ~<i>Booksmith<br></i><br>"<i>Consolations of the forest</i> [is] an extraordinary book...Tesson&#x2019;s literary gymnastics and personal eccentricities aside, <i>Consolations of the Forest</i> is also a paean to the vastness of Siberia and a way of life that, surely against the odds, still survives. It is a page-turner but one in the which the words themselves pull us from page to page until, like Tesson, we come to the end and must finally return to a more quotidian existence.&#x201d; ~<i>Asian Review of Books<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sylvain Tesson ventures where Thoreau only talked about&#x2014;into the wilderness of nature and solitude. He writes with the lyrical cynicism of a Raymond Chandler about nature, kitsch, violence, herd behavior, and the glory of paying attention. Equipped with books, cigars, and vodka, plus a good knife and solar panels, Tesson takes time to look real life in the eye, and&#x2014;in prose of startling clarity and candor&#x2014;makes a spiritual quest both suspenseful and funny. &#x2018;I will finally find out,&#x2019; he writes early on in his diary, &#x2018;if I have an inner life.&#x2019; He does.&#x201d;&nbsp;~Michael Sims, author of <i>The Story of Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</i> and the upcoming <i>Adventures of Henry Thoreau<br><br>".</i>..the pleasures of the few neighbors Tesson has &#x2014; and the company of two puppies &#x2014; enliven the narrative. It&#x2019;s almost enough to make the reader want to spend six months in isolation. Almost."<i> ~Vol. 1 Brooklyn<br><br></i>&#x201c;With <i>The Consolations of the Forest</i>, Tesson adds a modern voice to the rich literary history of contemplative nature writers like Thoreau and Emerson.&#x201d; ~<i>ForeWord Reviews<br></i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This book is to be savored work by word. I totally fell under the charm of its writing...I wanted to read and reread some passages, and that&#x2019;s why I took time to write down quotations. I have not done so to that extent for a long time, proof that this book is really amazingly beautiful...the author has a knack for seeing the beauty everywhere around him...something new and very refreshing.&#x201d; ~<i>Words and Peace<br><br></i>"A French journalist&#x2019;s eloquently philosophical diary of the six months he spent fulfilling his dream to &#x201c;live as a hermit deep in the woods&#x201d; of Siberia.&nbsp;The deeper he probed his own mind and heart, the more aware he became of himself as just another animal, like the wolves and bears with whom he shared the landscape. Comparisons to Walden are inevitable and, to an extent, justified. Yet what makes Tesson&#x2019;s work so refreshing is its freedom from Thoreau-vian moralizing. Solitude may be necessary and healing; but living life as a fully realized human being with attachments to society is an art rather than a thing to be despised. Moving, wise and profound." ~<i>Kirkus Reviews<br><br></i>"Tongue in cheek? Perhaps. Yet, for all his playfulness, Mr Tesson is in earnest. He loves the taiga and understands the Russians&#x2019; almost mystical attachment to it. Move over Schopenhauer. Aika and Bek know where the &#x201c;sweet spot&#x201d; is&#x2014;the present moment, that special place &#x201c;between longing and regret&#x201d; that Mr Tesson is ultimately in search of." ~<i>Economist.com<br></i></p><h2>Punk Rock Blitzkrieg: My Life as a Ramone</h2><p>The inside story behind one of the most revered bands in music history during the early days of punk rock in New York, from legendary drummer Marky Ramone.<br><br><i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked the Ramones at #26 on its list of the &#x201c;100 Greatest Artists of All Time.&#x201d; They received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011 and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.

My father was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, on August 11, 1931, and christened Peter, after my grandfather. My grandfather was a chef at the Copacabana for ten years before becoming the head chef at the &#x201c;21&#x201d; Club. The Copa, as it was known, was located on East Sixtieth Street in Manhattan and was owned by mob boss Frank Costello. Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin made their debuts there. If you were a singer, bandleader, or comedian in the forties and fifties and made it to the Copa, you had made it, period.<br> <br>My grandfather worked at &#x201c;21&#x201d; for eighteen years, right through its heyday. Established during Prohibition and located on West Fifty-Second Street in Manhattan, you could always spot the place thanks to all the painted statues of jockeys above the front entrance. Everyone who was anyone ate at &#x201c;21.&#x201d; My grandfather got to meet and hang out with stars including Humphrey Bogart, Jackie Gleason, and Judy Garland. These weren&#x2019;t just a bunch of tall tales&#x2014;my grandfather had the pictures to prove it! Whenever we visited my grandparents&#x2019; house, I would just stare at those photographs in awe that my grandfather actually knew the same people I saw on TV and in the movies.<br> <br>In 1944, my father and his parents moved from Hoboken to Brooklyn. My dad went to PS 217 elementary school on Coney Island Avenue, and that&#x2019;s where he met my mother. My mother&#x2019;s maiden name was Gertrude Joest. Most people called her Trudy. Her mother, Johanna, was French, and her father, Julius, was German. They immigrated to America in 1923 and settled in Willoughby, Ohio. My mother was born on September 10, 1931, in her parents&#x2019; home. Julius was an electrical engineer, and the family was middle class, but most babies at the time were still delivered by a midwife instead of in a hospital.<br> <br>When my mom was only two years old, her mother died. A few years later, Fredrick, my mom&#x2019;s older brother, died of pneumonia at the age of ten. Little Trudy and her dad moved to Cleveland for a few years before relocating to Brooklyn, New York. They lived on Ocean Parkway for a couple of years, and then moved to a four-story brick apartment building at 640 Ditmas Avenue, a few blocks south of Prospect Park. It was a solid working-class neighborhood made up mostly of modest private homes.<br> <br>Mom and Dad were friends for quite a few years before they started dating when they were around eighteen. About a year later, on December 15, 1950, they got married at city hall in Lower Manhattan. On July 15, 1952, my twin brother, Fred, and I were born at New York Infirmary Hospital.<br> <br>Our family lived with my grandfather Julius in a three-story brick walk-up, off the corner of President Street and Rogers Avenue in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. The buildings were all attached, usually with a little store on the ground floor and a separate stairway to the apartments above. Fred and I shared a room with bunk beds, which was fine with us because we got along really well.<br> <br>My father was a card-carrying longshoreman, and my mother worked as a secretary. They sent Fred and me to a racially integrated nursery school in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood just to the north. In the mid-fifties, most neighborhoods were segregated, but Fred and I were happy to be with kids from different cultures and made friends right away.<br> <br>One strange thing about our nursery school was the school bus. We didn&#x2019;t have one. What we had was a Cadillac hearse converted into a kind of station wagon minibus. It was big and black and came rolling up to the school like there was a funeral to attend. When the kids saw the hearse coming up the block, we would all run to try to get into the backseat first. It was roomy and padded back there, and it was cool to think this same compartment was once used for dead bodies. I loved riding with the window down. We all loved looking out the back window and making weird faces at the cars behind us.<br> <br>The only thing I really didn&#x2019;t like about nursery school was when they put us all down for naps in the middle of the day. I thought it was weird the way they set us all up on little floor mats and turned the lights out. There was plenty of daylight still coming in through the windows. I knew I was supposed to be quiet like everyone else, but it was hard. I knew there was no way I was going to fall asleep, so the best I could do was lie there with my eyes closed.<br> <br>I daydreamed about doing anything else but taking a nap. There were toys put away on shelves all around the room&#x2014;wooden blocks, a Slinky, Play-Doh, Mr. Potato Head, a Lionel train set&#x2014;and they were begging to be played with. After our nap, the teachers let us play a little rough, especially outdoors where we could just run around in the yard and make up our own games. To me, lying down on that mat and faking a nap was just a big waste.<br> <br>In 1957, Fred and I turned five, and we moved along with Grandpa Julius back to the four-story building at 640 Ditmas Avenue, where my mother had lived when she was little. The bunk beds moved with us, so I still had to share a room with Fred. That was fine, because we still got along.<br> <br>Dad and Grandpa Julius put their mechanical skills to work for Fred and me by helping us build a huge electric train set, which we played with for many hours. Dad also got us started building plastic models of cars, airplanes, and battleships. Fred loved making models of the Universal Studios monsters&#x2014;the Mummy, Dracula, the Wolf Man, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. He painted them almost lifelike.<br> <br>All the models required Testors glue, which had a very powerful smell that hit you sharply way up your nostrils. The smell was so bad it was good, and we got a little buzzed from it. That was the bonus of building models.<br> <br>There were no more naps once we got to elementary school. PS 217 was the same place our parents first met. Mom packed our lunch boxes. We got to play in the schoolyard at lunchtime. I got along with the other kids for the most part but got into a fight here and there. One time some kid in the bathroom accused me of stealing his grape juice. Why the hell would I want some kid&#x2019;s grape juice? So we got into it right then and there by the urinal until one of the male teachers burst in and broke it up. It was just kids&#x2019; stuff.<br> <br>When Fred and I got home, our grandfather Julius watched us until Mom and Dad got back from work. The deal was we would usually get our homework out of the way before we played. If the weather was bad, we would watch reruns of The Three Stooges Show, Abbott and Costello, or Adventures of Superman. The Three Stooges Show was probably my favorite because they were out of their minds with the slaps, hits, and smacks, but at the same time they were a unit&#x2014;a team. It was like three times as much comedy packed into a half hour as anybody else.<br> <br>Most days, I&#x2019;d be waiting outside our apartment building for my father to come home from work. When I saw my dad, I&#x2019;d run toward him to give him a big hug. I really looked up to my father. He was very relaxed about most things but firm when he had to be. My dad was six-foot-two-and-a-half, 230 pounds, and wore the thick, black-rimmed glasses that were popular at the time. He reminded me of Clark Kent. My mother looked like an actress. She was outspoken, and she was tough when she had to be. But my parents seemed to have a great relationship. I don&#x2019;t think I ever heard them argue, even once. If they did, it was never in front of us.<br> <br>When the weather was decent, Fred and I would usually play punch-ball or stickball with our friends from the neighborhood. Stickball was basically street baseball using a broom handle. When that got boring, we moved on to more exciting things like climbing fire escapes or sneaking into boiler rooms. We got into fights with kids from other blocks in the neighborhood, usually because someone was on someone else&#x2019;s turf. We were just your average kids from Brooklyn.<br> <br>On one particularly boring day, a friend had a cool idea to take a bunch of pillows and blankets, tie them together, and make a human dummy. We did a pretty good job considering we weren&#x2019;t pros. We carried the dummy up to the roof of our building and waited for a passerby.<br> <br>Timing was everything. When someone was walking along the sidewalk about fifty feet away from our target, we would toss the dummy over the parapet wall and scream at the top of our lungs like someone jumped. It worked. When you had less than a second to look up and figure out what was happening, it really looked like a falling body. People flipped out.<br> <br>One time we nailed a young couple carrying grocery bags. As the dummy plummeted to his &#x201c;death,&#x201d; the man and the woman both dropped their bags, and the groceries rolled all over the sidewalk and the street. Up on the roof we laughed so hard our eyes watered and our stomachs hurt. It was one of those laughs where you weren&#x2019;t sure you were going to be able to breathe ever again. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the parapet wall, I think we might have rolled off the roof and wound up like the dummy.<br> <br>The dummy always lived to see another day, and we kept getting better at throwing him. One time we threw him way out to the middle of Ditmas Avenue in front of an oncoming &#x2019;55 Plymouth. The driver hit the brakes hard and skidded just short of running over the dummy&#x2019;s head. The problem was that the driver and the passenger both hit their own heads on the dashboard. The other problem was the size of the driver. He was huge. And he was pissed off. He stepped out of the car, looked up, and spotted us up on the roof. It didn&#x2019;t help that we were laughing, but we stopped laughing when he shouted he was coming up there to throw us into the street next.<br> <br>We disappeared fast onto the rear fire escape, down the building stairway, anywhere to safety like a bunch of roaches scattering when the light comes on. There were places to hide in the basement. I came out when I figured it was safe. Whenever I thought about the stuff we did, I told myself that if you were a kid living in Brooklyn, getting in trouble was your job. Eventually the dummy got kind of beat-up and the prank got old, so we moved on to other things.<br> <br>I had a friend named Joel who lived in the building. He was a chubby kid. We hung out all the time, and Joel would do whatever the rest of us were doing. There was an empty lot close to our building where a bunch of us kids would go to have rock fights. One time I hit Joel with a rock and blood squirted out of his head like a fire hydrant. It was like a scene from a horror movie. One of the kids knew enough to apply pressure to the wound and stop the gusher. Amazingly, Joel didn&#x2019;t need stitches.<br> <br>Another time Joel and I were in a neighbor&#x2019;s yard trying to squeeze between two one-car garages to get to another yard, but Joel&#x2019;s big belly got stuck and he started to cry. I wanted to help him, but I was laughing so hard I was pretty useless. As I stopped laughing, I told him maybe we&#x2019;d have to get a crane and fish him out. Or maybe we&#x2019;d have to demolish one of the garages. Or maybe he would just have to lose some weight. Finally, I got him to stop crying and relax a little, and we wriggled him out. The next day, he told me his mother wouldn&#x2019;t let him play with me anymore.<br> <br>Not long after that, I was playing in my room with a kid named Robert, who I really didn&#x2019;t like that much. We were darting and jumping around the room and throwing whatever we could get our hands on. At one point I was on the top bunk and grabbed an old wooden milk crate off a shelf. I tossed it down to Robert, who tried to catch it and missed. One of the metal edges on the box caught him in the head.<br> <br>Blood was everywhere. It was like the sequel to the horror movie with Joel&#x2014;this time indoors with blood shooting all over the blankets and the walls. A few days later, I ran into Robert with a Band-Aid on his forehead, and he told me he wasn&#x2019;t allowed to play with me anymore. This became a pattern in my neighborhood. Ten years old and I had a reputation. As far as I was concerned, it wasn&#x2019;t deserved. I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt anyone. I was just out to have some fun.<br> <br>PS 217 was strict. In the morning we had to line up in the schoolyard and march into the building, grade by grade, like an army. Boys were required to wear a tie, a button-down shirt, and a sport jacket. For girls, the dress code was a skirt with dress shoes. The girls wound up looking like miniature versions of their mothers. Sneakers were forbidden for boys or girls except in gym.<br> <br>In the classroom, seating was in size order with the short kids at the front and the tall kids in the back. The desks were made of old dark wood that looked like it had been there from the day the school was built or maybe before. To get into your seat, you had to flip the desktop. There was a groove at the top for pens and pencils, and an inkwell with a brass lid. There were so many names carved into the desk that there were names carved over older names. Maybe if I looked hard enough, I could find Mom&#x2019;s and Dad&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Every day started with us standing, placing our right hands over our hearts, and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Once we sat down and started the lesson, we were expected to remain silent unless called upon. If anyone made a sound or caused any disruption, they&#x2019;d be punished. That usually meant standing in the corner and facing the wall. I had the corner memorized&#x2014;the little crack, the missing paint chips. Usually the teacher would also call your parents and let them know you had behaved badly.<br> <br>Once every week or two, a loud bell would ring, and we would do an emergency drill in case an atomic bomb was dropped. A few years earlier, the Soviet Union had developed its own atomic weapons, so we were expected to live on high alert. The drill was called &#x201c;duck and cover.&#x201d; There was even a goofy civil defense movie by the same name. The teachers marched us all into the auditorium and made us watch Bert the Turtle show us how to survive a nuclear holocaust. There were kids in the movie about our age, dressed neatly like us, who saw a flash of light in the sky. Instead of freaking out, they all calmly crawled under their desks, knelt down, and covered the backs of their heads and necks with their hands and shirt collars.<br> <br>It was hard not to laugh. Like squatting under a table was going to do anything in a massive atomic blast. But we did what they did, because what we were afraid of was not getting fried by a radioactive shock wave but getting sent to the corner to look at the wall. If we ever did see a flash of light in the sky and knew what was coming, I doubt we would have been quiet or gotten under the desks. I mean, this was Brooklyn.<br> <br>From the late fifties into the early sixties, things were pretty stable from year to year. That included our school, which stayed just about the same. The only thing that was changing was my attitude, which was getting more negative every semester. I was a hyper kid to begin with, so I had a really hard time sitting still. I&#x2019;d bang on the desk, melt crayons on the radiator, and constantly disrupt the class. I was fidgety. I had a hard time paying attention, and my mind would drift off. The teachers called my parents in so often that it got to be a drill&#x2014;as stupid as duck and cover.<br> <br>My father would sit me down and try to talk to me about my behavior. He&#x2019;d explain how important education was and ...</p><h2>Fantastic Dinosaur Adventure</h2><p>Emma, Ivan, and Conrad Dollybutt journey back in time in pursuit of the evil Sir Jasper Colleywobble and his henchman, Throttlethumbs, who have stolen Great-Uncle Lancelot&#39;s time machine</p><p>Grade 2 Up-- This book shares many problems with its predecessor, The Fantastic Flying Machine (S. &amp; S., 1989). It's unfortunate, because the premise is good: a time machine whisks the Dollybutt children back to dinosaur days in search of Sir Jasper Collywobble, a crook who's stolen their original time machine in order to go game hunting in prehistoric times. Durrell's at his best when he sticks to straight naturalist writing--describing the flora of the Jurassic period, for example, as seen through the children's eyes. But his crossovers to fantasy--having dinosaurs speak, for instance, or having children able to name the dinosaurs by sight--seem maudlin and contrived. While readers get snippets of Durrell's talent as a writer, most of this tale (and its bland illustrations) never lives up even to the quirkiness of the Dollybutt name. Cliched illustrations of white children and a swarthy villain do little to counteract racial stereotypes. And on top of all this, when the Dollybutts finally return to the present, with dinosaur babies in tow, what do they do but use their prehistoric friends for endorsements of products on television ads!

Meanwhile, the hip and sassy Fiks is an ambitious go-getter desperate to leave her vicious past behind for the glossy sophistication of city life, but finds Johannesburg to be more complicated and unforgiving than she expected. These two stories artfully come together to illustrate the weight of history upon a new generation in South Africa.</p></p><p><p><b>Kopano Matlwa</b> is the chairperson and founding member of Waiting Room Education by Medical Students, a nonprofit health promotion organization that uses students&#x2019; talents to educate patients on common health conditions in the waiting rooms of clinics.

To follow our Saviour is not about being nice. It&#39;s about taking risks. Simon writes: &#39;There&#39;s a battle going on for our hearts. What I watch, what I listen to, what I spend my time and money on - all these erode my true sense of identify and worth as a child of God. Where is the vigilance, the discernment, the scrutiny? Our hearts are far too precious to treat with such lax indifference ...I want to play my part in turning the world upside down; I want to be fearless, bold, uncompromising and passionate in reaching out to the lost on behalf of the King of Kings; I never want to get over the grace of God.&#39;</p><p>Simon Guillebaud is a missionary who has spent many years in Burundi.

It&#x2019;s a concept that has come to the attention of democratic reformers across the globe. Proposals for such bodies are being debated in Australia, Belgium, Iceland, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Sortition promises to reduce corruption and create a truly representative legislature in one fell swoop.</p><p>In <i>Legislature by Lot</i>, John Gastil and Erik Olin Wright make the case for pairing a sortition body with an elected chamber within a bicameral legislature. Gastil is a leading deliberative democracy scholar, and Wright a distinguished sociologist and editor of the Real Utopias series, of which this is a part. In this volume, they bring together critics and advocates of sortition who have studied ancient Athens, deliberative polling, political theory, social movements, and civic innovation. Without obscuring its limitations, the contributors offer a wide variety of ideas for how to implement sortition and examine its potential for reshaping modern politics.</p><p><i>Legislature by Lot</i> includes sixteen essays that respond to Gastil and Wright&#x2019;s detailed proposal. Essays comparing sortition to contemporary reforms see it as a dramatic extension of deliberative &#x201c;minipublics,&#x201d; which gather random samples of citizens to weigh public policy dilemmas without being empowered to enact legislation. Another set of essays explores the democratic principles underlying sortition and elections and considers, for example, how a sortition body holds itself accountable to a public that did not elect it. The third set of essays considers alternative paths to democratic reform, which limit the powers of a sortition chamber or more quickly establish a pure sortition body.</p><p>With contributions by Arash Abizadeh, Tom Arnold, Terrill Bouricius, Deven Burks, Lyn Carson, Dimitri Courant, Donatella della Porta, David M.

From Evangeline, Bradbury Fisher&#x2019;s fifth wife and a notorious &#x2018;golfing giggler&#x2019;, to poor Rollo Podmarsh whose game was so unquestionably inept that &#x2018;he began to lose his appetite and would moan feebly at the sight of a poached egg&#x2019;, the game of golf, its players and their friends and enemies are here shown in all their comic glory.</p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (P. G. Wodehouse) was an English humorist and writer best known for his Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels. Educated at boarding schools, Wodehouse turned to writing at a young age, demonstrating great skill at humorous sketches and musical lyrics. He continued to write part-time while pursuing, at the behest of his father, a career in banking, and successfully contributed numerous pieces to Punch, Vanity Fair, and The Daily Express, among other publications. In addition to his literary work, Wodehouse was incorporated into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in recognition of his collaboration with Cole Porter on Anything Goes, his lyrics to the song Bill from Show Boat, and his work on the musicals Rosalie and The Three Musketeers.<p>While interned along with other British citizens in Germany during the Second World War, Wodehouse made a series of radio broadcasts for which he was accused of being a collaborator; and, although later cleared of the charges, he never returned to England. His work has influenced many other writers including Evelyn Waugh, Rudyard Kipling, J. K. Rowling, and John Le Carr?. P. G. Wodehouse died in 1975 at the age of 93.</p></p><h2>The Secret Life of Bees</h2><p>Lily has grown up believing she accidentally killed her mother when she was four. She not only has her own memory of holding the gun, but her father&#39;s account of the event. Now fourteen, she yeams for her mother, and for forgiveness. Living on a peach farm in South Carolina with her father, she has only one friend: Rosaleen, a black servant whose sharp exterior hides a tender heart. South Carolina in the sixties is a place where segregation is still considered a cause worth fighting for. When racial tension explodes one summer afternoon, and Rosaleen is arrested and beaten, Lily is compelled to act. Fugitives from justice and from Lily&#39;s harsh and unyielding father, they follow a trail left by the woman who died ten years before. Finding sanctuary in the home of three beekeeping sisters, Lily starts a journey as much about her understanding of the world, as about the mystery surrounding her mother.</p><p>In Sue Monk Kidd's <i>The Secret Life of Bees</i>, 14-year-old Lily Owen, neglected by her father and isolated on their Georgia peach farm, spends hours imagining a blissful infancy when she was loved and nurtured by her mother, Deborah, whom she barely remembers. These consoling fantasies are her heart's answer to the family story that as a child, in unclear circumstances, Lily accidentally shot and killed her mother. All Lily has left of Deborah is a strange image of a Black Madonna, with the words "Tiburon, South Carolina" scrawled on the back. The search for a mother, and the need to mother oneself, are crucial elements in this well-written coming-of-age story set in the early 1960s against a background of racial violence and unrest. When Lily's beloved nanny, Rosaleen, manages to insult a group of angry white men on her way to register to vote and has to skip town, Lily takes the opportunity to go with her, fleeing to the only place she can think of--Tiburon, South Carolina--determined to find out more about her dead mother. Although the plot threads are too neatly trimmed, <i>The Secret Life of Bees</i> is a carefully crafted novel with an inspired depiction of character. The legend of the Black Madonna and the brave, kind, peculiar women who perpetuate Lily's story dominate the second half of the book, placing Kidd's debut novel squarely in the honored tradition of the Southern Gothic. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"This is the story of a young girl's journey toward healing, and of finding, at its end, not only wholeness, but the intrinsic sacredness of living in the world. I think it is simply wonderful" (Anne Rivers Siddons) <p>"Sue Monk Kidd's eccentric, inventive, and ultimately forgiving novel is reminscent of the work of Reynolds Price in its ability to create a truly original Southern voice." (Anita Shreve) </p><p>"I am amazed that this moving, original, and accomplished book is a first novel. It is wonderfully written, powerful, poignant, and humorous, and takes a line which is -- refreshingly -- strongly female without being cliche-feminist. It is also deliciously eccentric, which lifts it out of the usual category of a rite-of-passage novel into the realms of real distinction. DO read it." (Joanna Trollope) </p><p>"What a splendid novel! It's wonderfully thoughtful and sensitive and <i>compulsively</i> readable." (Susan Isaacs) </p><p>"The Secret Life of Bees is a novel of love and almost unbelievable courage, the quest of one young girl in search of her mother and so much more. Sue Monk Kidd takes on huge things, and by writing about what is mysterious, even difficult, in life, illuminates what is beautiful. She proves that a family can be found where you least expect it--maybe not under your own roof, but in that magical place where you find love. <i> The Secret Life of Bees</i> is a gift, filled with hope." (Luanne Rice, author of <i>Dream Country</i>) </p><p>"Writing with the intimate voice of the memoirist and with the Southerner's abiding sense of place, Sue Monk Kidd has written a forgiving story for the motherless child in all of us." (Shelby Hearon) </p><p>"Sue Monk Kidd has written a wonderful novel about mothers and daughters and the transcendent power of love, all the while masterfully illuminating the feminine face of God." (Connie May Fowler) </p><p>"With imagination as lush and colorful as the American South, a clutch of deliciously eccentric characters, and vivid prose, Sue Monk Kidd creates a rich, maternal haven in a harsh world." (Christina Schwarz) </p><p>"Sue Monk Kidd is an extraordinary storyteller. In "The Secret Life of Bees," she explores a young girl's search for the truth about her mother; her courage to tear down racial barriers; and her joy as she claims her place within a community of women. Beautifully written."

In 1862, eleven-year-old Summer and her 13-year-old brother Rosco take turns describing how life on the quiet Virginia plantation where they are slaves is affected by the Civil War.</p><p>Andrea Davis Pinkney has written several acclaimed picture books, works of nonfiction, and novels. Her fiction for middle-grade readers includes <i>Solo Girl, Raven in a Dove House, Silent Thunder,</i> and <i>Let It Shine,</i> a Coretta Scott King Honor winner. She is also the author of the picture books <i>Alvin Ailey, Duke Ellington,</i> and <i>Ella Fitzgerald,</i> all illustrated by her husband and frequent collaborator, Brian Pinkney. She lives with her family in Brooklyn, New York.<p>Gr 5-9-Set in 1862 in Virginia, the narrators enhance the poignancy of this story by Andrea Davis Pinkney (Hyperion, 1999) about two siblings, Summer and Roscoe, who are slaves on the Parnell Plantation. Roscoe, age 13, has learned to read while accompanying the master's son to his lessons. He teaches Summer, 11, her first letter by pointing out to her that the scar on her body is really the letter P, the master's brand. Andrea J. Johnson captures Summer's innocence and excitement about this new power and passion in her life, as well as the wisdom of Thea, the slave who can predict the future, and Mama's anger at what she considers her children's willfulness. Peter Jay Fernandez narrates Roscoe's dreams of freedom and also anxiety, as well as the grandeur of Dr. Bates' abolitionist speech on New Year's Eve, and Clem's desperation to gain his freedom. The arrogance of the "benevolent" masters and the indignity as well as forbearance and anger of the slaves are clearly presented in these voice. At times Summer sounds much older than her 11 years. Bits and pieces of the story are not always realized as fully as they could be; the hateful brother-in-law of Mrs. Parnell who comes to run the plantation leaves before he has even been fully introduced, and the ramifications of Dr. Bates' highly controversial speech are never included. Still, the story is engaging, and listeners feel as if they are sharing in the trials and tribulations as well as the triumphs of Roscoe and Summer.

The prisoners included European presidents, prime ministers, generals, British secret agents, and German anti-Nazi clerics, celebrities, and officers who had aided the July 1944 bomb plot against Hitler--and the prisoners' families. Orders were given to the SS: if the German military situation deteriorated, the prisoners were to be executed--all 139 of them.<br><br>So began a tense, deadly drama. As some prisoners plotted escape, others prepared for the inevitable, and their SS guards grew increasingly volatile, drunk, and trigger-happy as defeat loomed.

After studying philosophy and medicine in Prussia, Kaempfer went to Persia in 1684 as secretary to the Swedish ambassador, travelling via Moscow and the Volga to the Caspian and on to Isfahan. When the embassy returned to Sweden, Kaempfer stayed on, working as a physician for the Dutch East India Company in the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas. It was on his return to Europe twelve years later, after voyaging further afield to the Far East, that he wrote an extensive account of his travels, in the form of the <i>Amoenitatum Exoticarum</i>. Wide-ranging in its focus, the work is packed with absorbing detail. Book One provides us with a precise and systematic description of the principal political actors of the Safavid court, from the shah and prime minister and military, administrative, and religious leaders to the women of the harem and their eunuchs. We learn how the Persian state functioned in the hands of the staff of the royal court and urban and provincial officials. We are conducted around palaces and gardens and shown all the pageantry of the court, such as the ceremony involved in a royal audience or putting on a banquet. In Book Two, Kaempfer considers the theories of the day regarding the condition of the Caspian Sea and the oil fields of Baku a few hundred years before oil's worldwide commercialization; he gives the first detailed description, with illustrations, of Persepolis, and looks at the production of wine in Shiraz, which can be counted among the best in the world, in his view equal to burgundy or champagne. In Book Three, he debunks the European notion that in the East there existed a form of vegetable lamb (<i>borometz</i>); gives us an analysis of a much sought-after medicine, mumia; and provides an entertaining account of how Persians used cannabis for pleasure. Book Four, meanwhile, is entirely devoted to the date palm, its botany, cultivation, and manifold uses. Kaempfer brought an extraordinary level of objectivity and curiosity to his work, qualities that are reflected in <i>Amoenitatum Exoticarum</i>, making it a very reliable source of information. Rigorously scientific in his approach, he would not accept the authority of prior work on a subject unless he could verify it for himself, on site. He not only measured everything he saw but he also made precise drawings. Bringing alive for a modern audience the wealth of detail of the original work and its keen-eyed and scrupulous author, this new translation by Willem Floor and Collette Ouahes shines a spotlight on seventeenth-century Iran, providing a fascinating insight into the history and culture of the period.</p><p><p>INTRODUCTION xi</p><p>Who Was Engelbert Kaempfer? xi</p><p>Why This Translation? xv</p><p>BOOK ONE &#x2013; 1</p><p>FOREWORD 4</p><p>ONE</p><p>Concerning the King of the Persians, the Current Situation of the Kingdom<br> &amp; the Nature of Government in General 9</p><p>TWO</p><p>The Coronation of King Soleyman 28</p><p>THREE</p><p>Portrait of King Soleyman 41</p><p>FOUR</p><p>The First Man of the State, the <em>E`temad al-Dowleh</em> 55</p><p>FIVE</p><p>The Military Commanders &amp; the Persian Army 62</p><p>SIX</p><p>The Important Dignitaries of the Court, who are Members of the<br> Royal Council 69</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>The Administrators of the Exchequer.

This is the first book to be written about the Navy&#x2019;s role in the success of the Arab Revolt in the creation of the legendary figure of Lawrence of Arabia. Following extensive and detailed research into the activities of the ships of the Red Sea Patrol by the author, a maritime historian and former Merchant Navy officer, it has become evident that, without the work of those ships, the Arab revolt would have failed and T E Lawrence would have remained an obscure officer in the military bureaucracy of Cairo.<br><br>Lawrence was very aware of the importance and relevance of the Royal Navy in their operations in the Red Sea and commented on it on many occasions, notably in 1918, saying &#x2018;The naval side of the operations, when the time comes to tell of it, will provide a most interesting case of the value of command of the sea..&#x2019;. Until now, nobody has investigated this angle in any detail. By doing this so comprehensively, this book gives a fresh dimension to the Lawrence of Arabia legend.</p><p>John Johnson Allen went to sea in 1961 with BP Tanker Company as a navigating apprentice, rising to the rank of Second Officer. He then pursued a career in the property industry. He has a Master of Arts in maritime history, a Liveryman of the Honourable Company of Master Mariners and a Fellow of both the Royal Historical Society and a of the Royal Institute of Navigation. He has written two previous books Voices from the Bridge (with David Smith) and They Couldn&#x2019;t Have Done It Without Us: The Merchant Navy in the Falklands War. He lives in Norfolk."One of Johnson-Allen's strengths is his earlier experience as a Merchant Navy officer. Heunderstands the topography of the Red Sea coastline and also makes good use of the ship's logs at the National Archives. Johnson-Allen brings and engaging light to bear on a key aspect of the Arab Revolt." (<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"Concentrating on the naval side of the Red Sea Campaign, this work for history buffs and scholars describes the actions of T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), the leader of the Royal Navy&#x2019;s Red Sea Patrol during the Arab Revolt of the WWI period. The book begins with background on the events and forces leading to the Arab Revolt, then describes the actions of each ship of the Red Sea Patrol, drawing on the deck logs of each individual ship.

The process of globalization-with its promises of a common culture, a common currency, and a common government-offers a new political model for the world that fosters unity and community. <br>At the same time, however, this process threatens to destroy the values, norms, and ideals that particular cultures have wrought and established and to thereby diminish the power of each culture's unique identity. As globalization occurs, society must decide which values will be normative and what roles that social institutions like religion and education will play in selecting and fostering these values. The contributors to this volume examine both the promise and the threat of globalization using the tools of theological ethics to understand and evaluate the "social contexts of life at the deepest moral and spiritual levels." </p><p>This inaugural volume of a projected four volume series, Theology for the 21st Century: God and Globalization, examines five spheres of life-economics (Mammon), political science (Mars), psychology and sexuality (Eros), the mass media and the arts (Muses), and religion-that foster normative values for society. As the writers argue, their efforts attempt to determine whether "God is behind globalization in any substantive way." </p><p>Contributors to the volume include: Roland Robertson, University of Pittsburgh; Yersu Kim, UNESCO; Donald W.

How long it had stood here, not even its degenerate inhabitants knew.&#34; &#34;Your people came from Lake Zuad?&#34; questioned Conan. &#34;Aye. More than half a century ago a tribe of the Tlazitlans rebelled against the Stygian king, and, being defeated in battle, fled southward. For many weeks they wandered over grasslands, desert and hills, and at last they came into the great forest, a thousand fighting-men with their women and children. &#34;It was in the forest that the dragons fell upon them, and tore many to pieces; so the people fled in a frenzy of fear before them, and at last came into the plain and saw the city of Xuchotl in the midst of it. &#34;They camped before the city, not daring to leave the plain, for the night was made hideous with the noise of the battling monsters throughout the forest. They made war incessantly upon one another. Yet they came not into the plain. &#34;The people of the city shut their gates and shot arrows at our people from the walls. The Tlazitlans were imprisoned on the plain, as if the ring of the forest had been a great wall; for to venture into the woods would have been madness. &#34;That night there came secretly to their camp a slave from the city, one of their own blood, who with a band of exploring soldiers had wandered into the forest long before, when he was a young man. The dragons had devoured all his companions, but he had been taken into the city to dwell in servitude. His name was Tolkemec.&#34; A flame lighted the dark eyes at mention of the name, and some of the people muttered obscenely and spat. &#34;He promised to open the gates to the warriors. He asked only that all captives taken be delivered into his hands. &#34;At dawn he opened the gates. The warriors swarmed in and the halls of Xuchotl ran red. Only a few hundred folk dwelt there, decaying remnants of a once great race.

In the 1970s, he worked in South Dakota towns bordering three Indian reservations, including Pine Ridge.Wendelboe's debut, the absorbing first in a new Native American series, introduces FBI special agent Manny Tanno, a former Oglala Sioux tribal cop. When someone buries a war club in the head of Jason Red Cloud, an ambitious developer who put together a coalition of interests to build a resort overlooking the Wounded Knee site on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, Tanno reluctantly leaves his FBI academy teaching job to investigate. Tanno must face the enmity of acting chief Leon "Lumpy" Looks Twice as well as the tribe's distrust of FBI agents rooted in the American Indian Movement fiascos of the 1970s. To complicate matters further, Tanno's brother, Reuben, is a prime suspect. The residual animosities that divided the tribe during AIM's heyday, the awful heritage of the Wounded Knee Massacre, and the plight of the residents of the "poorest county in the nation" form a somber backdrop.

Katherine seems to have, as the title suggests, the perfect life-her two grown daughters are both pregnant, and her devoted and handsome husband Brad has just been named Humanitarian of the Year for his work at In Step, a ministry that rehabilitates houses for low-income people. Then disaster strikes-a beautiful young woman who once worked for Brad publicly accuses him of mishandling the ministry's finances, and of having an affair with her. When Brad denies both accusations, Katherine struggles with whether to believe him. She wrestles, too, with the fact that her church community largely abandons her in the wake of the scandal. Meanwhile, Katherine's two daughters clash over how to respond to their parents' crisis. Hatcher (Whispers from Yesterday) is a dab hand with dialogue, which is one reason her characters are so well drawn: readers will feel empathy with all members of the family.

Murray provides great insight on how to grow closer to Jesus. Andrew Murray was a South African pastor and Christian writer who considered missions to be the chief ed of the church. Murray was one of the leading figures during the South African Revival of 1860. Today he is best remembered as a writer of hundreds of Christian books, many of which are still widely read today including Abide in Christ, Absolute Surrender, and With Christ in the School of Prayer.</p><p>Andrew Murray (1828&#x2013;1917) was a South African writer, teacher, and Christian pastor. Murray considered missions to be "the chief end of the church." Andrew pastored churches in Bloemfontein, Worcester, Cape Town and Wellington, all in South Africa. He was a champion of the South African Revival of 1860. In 1889, he was one of the founders of the South African General Mission (SAGM), along with Martha Osborn and Spencer Walton. After Martha Osborn married George Howe, they formed the South East Africa General Mission (SEAGM) in 1891. SAGM and SEAGM merged in 1894. Because its ministry had spread into other African countries, the mission's name was changed to Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF) in 1965. AEF joined with SIM in 1998 and continues to this day. He died on January 18, 1917, four months before his eighty-ninth birthday. Over the years he has influenced many, including Jessie Penn-Lewis, a key figure in the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival.</p><h2>The Bestiary of Christ</h2><p>A legendary work of religious scholarship and art history--now available in its first English translation.

Burke's client is a woman named Flood, who has the face of an angel, the body of a high-priced stripper, and the skills of a professional executioner. She wants Burke to find a monster -- so she can kill him with her bare hands. In this cauterizing thriller, Andrew Vachss's renegade private eye teams up with a lethally gifted vigilante to follow a child's murderer through the catacombs of New York, where every alley is a setup for a mugging and every tenement has something rotten in the basement. Fearfully knowing, buzzing with narrative tension, and written in prose as forceful as a hollow-point bullet, <i>Flood</i> is Burke at his deadliest -- and Vachss at the peak of his form. <br> <br> <strong>An Interview with Andrew Vachss on <i>Another Life</i>, the Final Book in the Burke Series</strong> <br> <p> <b>Q: There has been some discussion that this might be the last novel in the Burke series. Do you see it that way? And if so, why?</b></p> <p>Andrew Vachss: I don't just "see" it that way, I <i>wrote</i> it that way. <i>Another Life</i> is the coda to the Burke novels, the final chapter in a series that has been running since 1985. The timing was no accident. If I was to keep faith to those who gone the distance with me, I had to be true to my original promise: unlike some series in which the protagonist never ages, I set out to have each book show the main characters not only aging, but changing as well. Even dying. This series is all about "Family of Choice." All the members of Burke's family share this truth: The most righteous of parents don't want their children to "follow in their footsteps," they want their children to walk <i>past</i> those footsteps. Burke's family have always walked the outlaw road, and can never walk another. But as the children reach adulthood, it is the family's blood obligation to fork that road for them. And that time has now come.</p> <p><b>Q: This is the 18th volume in the Burke series. How has the series changed? How have the issues you address in the novels changed over the years?</b></p> <p>AV: I am not sure the series <i>has</i> changed... because all the changes depicted throughout have been part of the original concept. Of all of the descriptions of my books, Sonny Mehta dubbing them "investigative novels" is the one I am proudest of, because I wanted the books to be Trojan horses, a platform from which I could show people a world known only to the "Children of The Secret." I didn't know there was a name for such an intent until I won the Grand Prix de Litt�rature Polici�re and a French reporter told me the Burke series was "litt�rature engage�." My goal was not to raise consciousness, but to raise <i>anger</i>. Ours is a country where anything can be accomplished if enough people get angry... because, in America, we <i>act</i> on our collective anger. If you want proof of how that works, just take a look at how New York State finally closed the hated (and virtually unknown) &#x201c;incest exception.&#x201d; When I first wrote about predatory pedophiles modem-trafficking in kiddie porn, reviewers condemned the book as a product of my "sick imagination." Who would say that today? Time and time again what I have written about has "come true." This is not because I am prescient, it is that my work takes me places most citizens never see. So the issues never really change, but as more and more folks become aware of the foundational truth in my "fiction," those issues no longer flourish in the shadows. Years after the series launched, enough folks focused their rage at how children are seen as property in America to form the first PAC (Political Action Committee) solely devoted to child protection. Anyone who says "books don't change anything," or--more commonly--that crime fiction is the wrong genre for promoting social change--should take a closer look.</p> <p><b>Q: Burke has a very close family of choice. What drew these people together, and what do you see is the future for them, beyond the series?</b></p> <p>AV: It would be easy to say that everyone in Burke's family was a "Child of The Secret," but that would not be true. What they have most powerfully in common is a marrow-deep hatred of humans who prey on children. The rest of the question is actually answered within the book itself, and I'm not a fan of "spoilers."</p> <p><b>Q: Over the years, you're consistently ahead of the curve in terms of spotting cultural, political, and criminal trends before they become headlines. How are you constantly able to do this? And is there anything in this new novel that you think is likely to be in tomorrow's headlines?</b></p> <p>AV: It's no great trick to spot things you see with your own eyes, which is why I wrote about predatory pedophiles deliberately seeking work in day care centers, or organ trafficking, or cults practicing "baby-breeding"... it's a long list. Most folks had never even heard the word "piquerist" before my novel on the subject. And although it looks as if I "predicted" the use of the Internet to lure children, or what I called "noir v�rit�," etc., I was functioning far more as journalist than a novelist when I wrote about such things. Burke has two extraordinary skills which set him apart from his contemporaries: the "pattern-recognition software" inside his mind, and his ability to extract information. <i>Another Life</i> is going to showcase both of those skills far more than any previous book. As for "tomorrow's headlines," you have to remember that I <i>wrote</i> the book over a year ago... so some have already surfaced. Ask my scalpel-penciled editor--Edward Kastenmeier--if you doubt my word. Many times we have had to alter a manuscript because what I was "predicting" had just come to pass. I don't know how long it is going to take for <i>some</i> of the truth revealed in <i>Another Life</i> to reach public consciousness. It may be "tomorrow's headlines"... or it may be another year or two. But if you look at my track record, you'll know where to put your money down. </p> (Photo Credit National Association to Protect Children)Burke&#39;s newest client is a woman named Flood, who has the face of an angel, the body of a high-priced stripper, and the skills of a professional executioner.

Whitty lives in northern California.1 Rapture <br><br>All day we have been observing the surgeonfish, which the Tahitians call maroa and the French call chirurgien, streaming over the outer reef slopes in tightly knit single files. Now, in the final hour of daylight, scores of them coalesce into banners of yellow-and-blue fins, flowing gaudily over the contours of the coral toward the edge of Tiputa Pass. Bunched into agitated crowds of hundreds, they rise above the reefs, swarming and butting each other in a chaos of seeming cross purposes.<br> Stimulated by the onset of a waning moon in the South Pacific, the surgeonfish cluster, rise, bump, then drop back to the reef, disperse, circle, regroup, and rise again. A dozen times they practice, each round taking them higher into the water column, farther from the safety of the coral. The foreplay culminates in what scientists call spawning and what the French divers I&#x2019;m with charmingly refer to as lovemaking a pair of surgeonfish detaching from the crowd and exploding upward in an impossibly fast arc, then ejecting their sperm and eggs into the open water in a burst of milky smoke. Never breaking stride, the pair shoots back to the reef at speeds nearly unrecordable by the human eye. Other pairs follow. And others. At the apex of each upward burst, the ejaculated white puff-balls hang still, yet riotously mobilized as the chemistry of conception begins, sperm seeking eggs with 3 only a moment for the microjourney to succeed before the gametes are caught in the outflow of water from the pass, torn apart, and carried out to deep water.<br> When it&#x2019;s too dark underwater to see anymore, we motor back to land against a sunset as soft and mutable as a watercolor. While we rinse our gear at the dock, my fellow divers have blissful expressions on their faces. It&#x2019;s always this way. It doesn&#x2019;t matter who they are, what their names are, or where the coral reef is; but in this case, as we return from Tiputa Pass at Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, the faces are those of two young Frenchmen. Both guide here professionally, at this fragile edge between land and sea. If anyone would be jaded it would rightfully be them. But the opposite has happened. The rapturous state induced by the reef has caught these tough young men in its spell and rendered them, for this moment, as beatific as angels.<br> It&#x2019;s rare in the wild to see the moment of conception, and our mood is joyful, relieved, as if we&#x2019;ve conquered some summit and survived. The French divers are happy this day delivered up such a pretty secret. Back in my fare (bungalow), I check my underwater slate, eager to transcribe its notes into my journal only to laugh when I discover nothing more than a single exclamation point marked on it.<br> Such is the paradox of the reef: a world that feels purely and extravagantly sensual yet exists mostly outside our own sensory realm. We smell nothing underwater (although the sea is filled with scents), taste only the metallic twang of compressed air, see poorly, and are reduced to nondirectional hearing; in effect, we&#x2019;re disabled. Nor can we talk. Without language, without the correct words, or any words, human divers revert to a preverbal state of mind. So the dive you&#x2019;ve just made tends to be felt rather than accurately remembered, and the little plastic slate you&#x2019;ve dutifully carried underwater for note-taking reveals only doodles or strange hieroglyphs made more difficult to decipher since the pencil marks, supposedly erasable by scrubbing with beach sand, never really do come clean, leaving you to contend with the ghostly outlines of all your previous, equally enigmatic dives.<br> This is the struggle, or at least my struggle, working underwater: how to comprehend and then translate the otherworldly marvels under the surface into the alien world topside.<br><br>On all of planet earth exist only three hundred thirty coral atolls (Malayam atolu: reef; from adal: closing, uniting), the necklace-shaped islands consisting of sandy islets surrounding a tropical lagoon. Rangiroa is one of the seventy-seven atolls comprising the Tuamotu Archipelago, itself one of the five archipelagos of French Polynesia. Taken together, all the islands of French Polynesia cover an area of the South Pacific larger than western Europe, and the Tuamotus inhabit a seascape larger than California.<br> Millions of years ago, the Tuamotu Archipelago was the scene of rampant vulcanism fueled by a rising plume of magma known as a hot spot under the Pacific plate. Today these islands sit atop a wracked area of sea floor known as the Tuamotu Ridge, which marks the eastern edge of the volcano-scarred western Pacific. To the east, as far as the Americas, lies an entirely different bathymetry, a relativelly featureless underwater plain scored by a series of east-west running fracture zones. The Tuamotus lie between the Marquesas Fracture ZZZZZone to the north and the Easter Fracture Zone to the south the names indicative of some of the Tuamotus&#x2019; nearest neighbors.<br> This is an isolated place. The nearest continental land to Rangiroa Atoll lies four thousand miles due south at Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica, and the nearest inhabited land of any size lies forty-four hundred miles due west at the Cape York Peninsula on Australia&#x2019;s northernmost tip. To find anything substantial in the opposite direction, you have to travel five thousand miles east to Peru. There is hardly a place on the globe farther from continental landmasses, and as a result both the underwater and the topside worlds are dominated by the Pacific Ocean.<br> The superlatives surrounding this far from peaceful body of water are daunting. At sixty-four million square miles, it&#x2019;s larger than the total land area of the world combined, covers a full one-third of our planet, and contains more than half the world&#x2019;s seawater. It is home to thirty thousand islands and five climate regions the westerlies, the trades, the monsoon region, the typhoon region, and the doldrums. Its basin is deeper than that of any other ocean, maintaining an average draft of fourteen thousand feet, and in places plunging abysmally to a world-record-setting thirty-six thousand feet, about seven miles. The Pacific encompasses the epicenter of coral evolution today, and is home to 40 percent of all the world&#x2019;s reefs, including our planet&#x2019;s most extensive barrier reef and atoll formations. On this unfathomably productive and dangerous seascape, tiny Rangiroa floats like a fallen flower petal seemingly too small to survive or to be survived upon.<br> Yet this is the second largest atoll on earth, stretching roughly fifty miles from east to west and twenty miles from north to south. It encloses a nearly four-hundred-square-mile lagoon within a one-hundred-forty-mile bracelet of islets four hundred eighteen islets in all. Called motu by the Tahitians, these islets are almost as insignificant as midoceanic shoals, since they rise only fifteen feet above sea level, are virtually devoid of freshwater, and possess only sand for soil. Yet they have been tenaciously colonized by Polynesian people throughout the South Pacific. In fact, the sandy motu of atoll islands have always welcomed open-ocean sailors, including the drift-seeds and drift-fruits that bob on the waves: the coconut, the mangroves, and their unwitting passengers of insects, crabs, and seabirds.<br> To stare out at Rangiroa&#x2019;s lagoon is akin to looking over an infinite ocean, with the motu on the far side lost beneath the curvature of the earth. In fact, the only clue you have that it is not the ocean is its relative calm. Three hundred feet away on the open-ocean side of the motu, the surf thunders day and night without pause, whereas most days the lagoon side is as calm as a millpond, its tranquil waters painted in so many vibrant shades of blue and green and turquoise and beryl that you conclude the ancient Tahitians had it right, that God is not in the clouds but in the lagoon.<br><br>Because of its geography, Rangiroa has a tremendously dynamic reef system. Its four hundred eighteen motu are separated by tidal channels called hoa most of which are too shallow for anything but the smallest boats to travel through, and some are too small for that. Yet Rangiroa also possesses the crown jewel of atolls two navigable hoa, five hundred yards wide, known as Tiputa Pass and Avatoru Pass.<br> Partly because of these passes, the changing of the tides at Rangiroa Atoll produces an extraordinary phenomenon of pressures and counterpressures as seawater either presses into the lagoon or rapidly escapes from it. At these times, Tiputa Pass in particular is transformed into a maelstrom of inflow and outflow, water colliding and spinning off whirlpools that appear underwater as snaky tornadoes of blinding sediment. The French call this the mascaret, translated as a high wave that travels backward up large rivers during flood tides. In Rangiroa, the word refers to conditions that occur when the tide is flowing out of the lagoon into the open sea and the wind is blowing against it, or vice versa. This happens once or twice a day when the battle between wind-driven currents and water-driven currents result in waves climbing each other&#x2019;s faces and battling to a standstill in other words, becoming standing waves, which in Tiputa Pass can reach fifteen feet.<br> No human diver can survive immersion into the full brunt of the mascaret. So those of us who come to Rangiroa dive its edges, where the noise of the rip tide rumbles beneath the brighter soundtrack of the sea, the snapping, clicking, rasping, buzzing, squealing, and grunting of fish, shrimp, clams, and corals at work. For these creatures, the waxing and waning of the mascaret is an external force akin to a combined circulatory and respiratory system an enormous set of oceanic lungs inhaling and exhaling four times a day, pausing briefly in the slacktide. In this way the sea is enriched: huge loads of organic matter emptying out of the lagoon to nourish the outer reef slopes, immeasurable quantities of clear water from the open sea rushing back to refresh it.<br><br>As with many of my dives in the course of shooting four nature documentaries here, Yann Hubert is guiding the way. I&#x2019;m familiar with his yogilike presence underwater. Simply put, he&#x2019;s the best diver I&#x2019;ve ever seen a total contrast to his dry-world persona, which tends to fidgety boredom, chain-smoking, and amusing himself with incomprehensibly profane and colloquial French jokes. But down here he&#x2019;s a master, breathing so rarely, so delicately, that fish sidle up to him as if he were not, like the rest of us, an intruder from another world. I believe I understand his secret: total compliance with the environment. Rather than challenge the currents he remains still, using the minimum angulation of body or fins to move. But even knowing this, I&#x2019;m stunned to see after surreptitiously checking his gauges at the end of several dives that he doesn&#x2019;t consume enough air to sustain human life.<br> This morning, we descend through a crowd of yellowspot emperors resting in the shade cast by our inflatable Zodiac boat, then beyond them, through a phalanx of batfish, steely and triangular as arrowheads. Yann drifts to my left, falling lightly through the center of a silvery cyclone of thousands of blackfin barracuda riding one another&#x2019;s tails in a vortex of their own making. They open up to let him through, then close ranks behind him.<br> Far below the coral appears, mottling the sandy bottom in deepening shades of blue. Large animals drift over it; a manta ray sailing the edge of the current, ghostly schools of gray reef sharks, hundreds packed shoulder to shoulder, shoaling like lowly sardines. This is their chief defense against even larger predators, and proof that there is no absolute invincibility in the sea. A few rise to greet us, their blunt bodies cruising through schools of bluelined snappers.<br> This is the season when great hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna mokarran), which the French call grand requin marteau and the Tahitians call mao tuamata, cruise Tiputa Pass, snacking on reef sharks exhausted after bloody mating rituals. Although the two cameramen I&#x2019;m with are busy at the moment filming the cyclone of barracuda and a large, friendly napol�on wrasse, we are all hoping that one of the ten- or twelve-foot (or more) hammerheads will sidewind its way over the bottom and frighten the reef sharks into acting like a school of oversized minnows.<br> Yet there are many other creatures of interest, including a small squadron of spotted eagle rays sailing the wall of coral below. These are among the most graceful animals in the sea, adorned with Art Deco designs of white circles and polka dots on velvety black backgrounds. They appear to be all wings and soar as hydrodynamically as underwater kites. This group is in nuptial flight, with seven males in pursuit of a female.<br> I wave at the cameramen, one below me, one above. But they are focused on their own tasks and blinded by their dive masks. I shout, and a profusion of bubbles rises from the regulator in my mouth, drawing a curtain over the scene. Though my voice is deafening in my own head, it cannot travel the short distance to either cameraman through the dense medium of the water. Frustrated, I swim through my bubbles to the downhill cameraman, grab him, and point. He flinches from the contact, as we all do when touched underwater, then follows my finger. Less than a minute has elapsed since I saw the spotted eagle rays, yet already they have faded to faint shadows silkscreened on the distant ocean. He looks in my eyes and shrugs. The rays are barely twitching their wingtips, yet we could never, in our wildest dreams, hope to catch them.<br> This is only one of what amounts to thousands of missed opportunities underwater opportunities missed so regularly and predictably that filming or working here becomes a Zen exercise in detachment. If we were to want the eagle rays too much, or to find ourselves filled with regret at having missed them, then our experiences underwater would quickly become bitter ones. Just to test our knowledge of this, we also, on this dive, miss filming a triggerfish building a nest, a traveling circus of bumphead parrotfish, and, on the smallest scale, a starfish shrimp from the genus Periclimenes living nearly perfectly camouflaged atop its host sea star.<br> Copyright � 2007 by Julia Whitty.

Clark's landscape is well populated with colorful characters he has known. There are the prominent: John Wetherill, the controversial trader who discovered the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde; Harry Goulding, who dreamed of turning the majestic Monument Valley into a first-rank tourist attraction; Louis L'Amour, the western novelist. There are the unknown: Harold Baxter Liebler, an Episcopal missionary with profound sensitivity to Native American cultures; and Clark's hiking buddy, Joe, with whom the author explores ancient ruins and searches for a long-dead, mysterious soldier. Mystery and magic, in fact, are never far from the center of the volume. Many of the stories involve Navajo witchcraft and spirits. One of the most successful depicts a confrontation between a Navajo fundamentalist Christian and a medicine man; and the author's humorous dealings with a sharp Indian trader named Santiago are equally memorable.

The fluttering of wings and the sight of a diving sparrow chilled me.<br><br>Erica Silvermead, the sparrow who now shifted into her human form in front of me, had been guarding the front door of the palace. Her presence here meant that our dangerous visitor had arrived.<br><br>Politely excusing myself from the merchant I had been speaking with, I followed Erica into the palace.<br><br>Once we were alone, she confirmed my assumption. "Syfka, speaker for Empress Cjarsa, is at the gate. She has requested an audience with you and your pair bond."<br><br>I would have liked nothing more than to order the guard and the Royal Flight to ban Syfka from our lands, but insulting the falcons would be suicide. While the serpiente retained only ancient dances and half-remembered stories from the days of Maeve's coven, the falcons' powers were still strong. Their royal house supposedly consisted of the four falcons who had once practiced among the Dasi, kept alive by a combination of Ahnmik's and Leben's magics.<br><br>If the legend was true, Syfka was one of those four and, as such, a creature whose might was too great to fathom. Even if it was false, Syfka represented an empire we could not risk slighting.<br><br>I nodded reluctantly, taking a detour to find my mate.<br><br>We caught Danica just as she was leaving the synkal, where her lessons were held. She was languid from exhaustion, but she smiled upon seeing me, and my heart warmed just from the sight of her golden hawk eyes lighting up. Then she saw my worried gaze, and her expression suddenly mirrored my own.<br><br>"Syfka is here?" she asked.<br><br>"At the gate."<br><br>Danica shuddered, but joined Erica and me on our hasty walk toward the entryway. "Syfka was never an enemy of my people during the war, but she made it clear that falcons held no respect for avians no matter how similar our second forms may seem. Whatever she is here for now, I suggest we deal with it quickly."<br><br>"We're in agreement, then."<br><br>Ailbhe, the head of the palace guard, was waiting with our visitor by the doorway. The white viper stood at strict attention, tension wavering in the air around his silent form, his gaze fixed not quite on the falcon, but never moving far from her.<br><br>Syfka radiated an aura of heat that rivaled even Danica's constant warmth. Her hair was pale gold, and in the front it faded to silver; her eyes were crystalline blue, set in milk-pale skin. Wings rose from her shoulders and cascaded down her back, with the golden undersides and brown, gray and black markings of an aplomado falcon.<br><br>She was stunning, and like all falcons, she had a magnetic air that could draw mortals to her like moths to fire--ultimately to meet with the same demise, if they dared offend her. Right now she was standing formally with her left hand clasping her right wrist behind her back. It was the respectful pose of a soldier, but Syfka's expression told me clearly that the respect was not for me.<br><br>As her eyes met mine, it was easy to believe this creature was as ancient as myth. She gave a nod that might have served as a bow, if it had been accompanied by anything other than obvious disdain. "Zane Cobriana, Danica Shardae, I appreciate that you are prompt. I am looking for one of our people, who I have reason to believe is in this area."<br><br>"A falcon?" I could not help frowning. "Not among the serpiente. Danica?"<br><br>My mate's expression remained calm, though I knew her well enough to feel her agitation and anxiety building. "You are the only falcon who has visited our lands in the last decade," she answered.<br><br>Syfka looked amused. "The falcon could have altered its form, its coloring," she explained, her voice patient, as if she was speaking to a young child. "I hesitate even to offer a gender, as that could feasibly be hidden, too. Unless you'd seen the person's falcon form, there would be no way to know."<br><br>"Then why ask us?" I replied, irritated by her patronizing tone only barely more than by her request. I struggled to keep my voice from revealing my annoyance. "If there's no way for us to tell whether someone is a falcon, how can we help you search?"<br><br>Syfka nodded toward Danica. "Though it seemed unlikely, I thought the criminal might have asked for asylum from the Tuuli Thea, since some on the island know of our past alliance with the avian people."<br><br>"May I ask what he or she has done?" Danica inquired.<br><br>"That is not your concern." Syfka's words were brisk.<br><br>I might have argued, had I thought the falcon was someone I knew, but I doubted that was the case. Someone trying to hide was unlikely to befriend the king of the land.<br><br>Danica also held back any protests she had. If we discovered the so-called criminal, we might dispute Syfka's words, but for now we might as well work with her.<br><br>Danica echoed my thoughts. "So many people pass through the court every day that a newcomer could remain unnoticed for some time unless he introduced himself to the Tuuli Thea. I can, however, see if my guards have noticed anything unusual."<br><br>"I will speak with the serpiente," I added. "If there are any newcomers in these lands, the dancers at least will know of them." While the Cobriana were the heart of the serpiente, the dancers were its blood; nothing went on in the royal house, the market or the most distant serpiente lands that the dancers did not know about eventually.<br><br>Syfka nodded curtly. "See that you do. I want this done quickly, so I can leave this equakeiel." The last word was in the old Dasi language, spoken in falcon lands, of which I knew a little. Syfka's description of our lands was not flattering.<br><br>"If you are so displeased to be here," I suggested delicately, "you are welcome to leave and let us conduct this search on our own."<br><br>"You would never recognize a hidden falcon without my assistance. Your kind is as blind to Ahnmik's magic as a worm is to the sun." I heard her add under her breath, "You notice it only when it scalds you."<br><br>Abruptly she returned to falcon form and took to the sky.<br><br>I will return shortly to see to your progress.<br><br>The words whispered through my mind like a line of lyrics heard even after a song has ended. I had no doubt they came from Syfka, and the sense of her even so briefly inside my mind left an unpleasant chill.<br><br>Beside me, Danica went pale, her body swaying. I moved closer, and she caught my arm, drawing in a slow breath as she closed her eyes.<br><br>"Are you all right?"<br><br>"I'm fine," she answered. "I was just a little dizzy for a moment." Danica shook her head as if to clear it. "I spent most of this morning practicing with A'isha; perhaps I overtaxed myself."<br><br>I glanced from Danica to her guard; Erica looked as worried as I felt. Then again, the sparrow's whole frame had already been taut as a wire. Facing a falcon, against whom all her fighting prowess would not let her win, had left her visibly tense.<br><br>Syfka had asked for our help, even though she had dismissed our ability to give any. Harming us now would be sabotaging herself. Wouldn't it?</p><h2>The 50 Greatest Love Letters of All Time</h2><p>If a picture speaks a thousand words, a love letter speaks a thousand more . . .<br><br>Even in this age of e-mail, faxes, and instant messaging, nothing has ever replaced the power of a love letter.

(The pieces on the pianist Bill Evans and on the classic 1957 CBS television show, "The Sound of Jazz," have not been published before.) Balliett gives brilliant final summings-up of many of the irreplaceable musicians who died in the eighties, among them Count Basie, Earl Hines, Thelonious Monk, Buddy Rich, Sarah Vaughan, and Cootie Williams. But he also offers penetrating assessements of young turks like Michael Petrucciani, Warren Vache, Howard Alden, and Wynton Marsalis. Jazz is passing through a recollective period, and Balliett takes long looks at the great Blue Note, Keynote, and Commodore reissue programs, the new jazz repertory groups, and the ambitious and wayward Grove Dictionary of Jazz. He puts his elegant glass on a Caribbean jazz cruise, on several different festivals, on the sad dissolution of the marvelous Gene Bertoncini-Michael Moore duo, and on the strange career of Miles Davis. And he gives us definitive essays on Bunny Berigan, Duke Ellington, John Hammond, Benny Goodman, Ben Webster, and the early lyrical jazz writer Otis Ferguson. Jazz fans and jazz musicians read Balliett because of his unrivalled ability to convey in words the very sound of their music. But people who don't know beans about jazz read him simply to relish his elegant and beautiful prose.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Whitney Balliett</strong> has been the jazz critic of <em>The New Yorker</em> since 1957. This is his fourteenth book on the subject.<br>A fine 14th book from Balliett (Bradley, Barney and Max, 1989, etc.)--taken, like many others, from his New Yorker jazz column- -that is, he suggests, his farewell jazz hard-cover. And the pages overflow with goodbyes to great jazzmen who have died, many in the past decade, with genial elegies for Duke Ellington, Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, Benny Goodman, Thelonius Monk, Count Basie, Earl Hines, Sarah Vaughan, and Bill Evans. Balliett also reviews Gunther Schuller's The Swing Era and James Lincoln Collier's Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong bios. Collier does not get high marks for either of his books; the Armstrong bio is faulted for not covering Pops's big-band Decca years and for not breathing life into him through lively interviews on hand from his friends and sidemen, and the Ellington bio for dismissing the Duke's later concert pieces. Balliett thinks that ``It is unlikely that anyone will write a good biography of Duke Ellington.'' Nicely handled here is electrifying trumpeter Bunny Berrigan, whose virtuosic agility has never been more aptly limned in words. Also well examined are hornplayers Warren Vache, Rex Stewart, Jabbo Smith, Dizzy Gillespie, Bill Coleman, Cootie Williams, and Wynton Marsalis. Miles Davis is given a stiff rap on the forebrain for hiding in heavy metal and forgoing his genius. Ol' Blue Eyes's package of 83 songs recorded with the Dorsey band is called largely inert, with only a handful of livelier, more choice ballads singled out for praise. Love for swing drummers Big Sid Catlett and Buddy Rich sings off the page, with their every rim shot, press roll, cymbal smash, or snare whisper itemized and weighed for color. If this is it, Balliett leaves in top form and we are all in his debt. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This totally revised and greatly expanded edition of <em>Dictionary of Idioms</em> examines over 500 such phrases, tracing each one's source and history through a rich supply of examples. New entries include 'playing fast and loose' (from a 16th-century fairground game), 'head over heels' (a totally illogical variation on the more sensible 'heels over head') and 'knee-high to a grasshopper' (which won out over knee-high to a mosquito and knee-high to a toad). Mini-essays scattered through the book enable the authors to expand on such broader themes as: What is an Idiom?, National Rivalries, and the Old Curiosity Shop of Linguistics. While maintaining scholarly accuracy, Linda and Roger Flavell convey their great love of the curious in language in a way that will be irresistible to anyone who delights in words.</p><p>Linda and Roger Flavell have been studying the oddities of English for over 25 years.

From early childhood in Cardiff and the valleys of South Wales to school and adolescence in Manchester and more, the book brilliantly recaptures the formation of the young man who finally decides not to write novels but to become a scholar. First recounting, in coruscating detail, life and work with John Pope-Hennessy at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and then narrating the debate and final acceptance of an invitation from the Warburg Institute at London University, <i>Episodes</i> shows the formation of the extraordinarily learned and original mature scholar. A personal testimony, a spellbinding series of vignettes and characterizations of famous and infamous contemporaries, and a contribution to the cultural history of the mid-20th century, this is an essential and unforgettable book.</p><p>Michael Baxandall was probably the most influential art historian of his generation. In books including Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy, The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany, Patterns of Intention and Tiepolo and the Pictorial Intelligence (with Svetlana Alpers) he expanded the discipline&#39;s range of topics, approaches, and ways of writing. A professor at London&#39;s Warburg Institute and the University of California at Berkeley, he was also a member of the British Academy, and was awarded the Mitchell Prize, and prizes by the University of Hamburg, and the MacArthur Foundation. He died in 2008. One of Europe&#39;s most celebrated historians, Carlo Ginzburg is best known for his ground-breaking microhistory The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth Century Miller, which examined the beliefs of an Italian heretic. Other works include The Night Battles, on European witch persecutions, and The Judge and the Historian. He has been instrumental in persuading the Vatican to open the Inquisition Archives to researchers.Cultural historians will welcome this posthumous memoir by an authoritative, independent-minded art critic and scholar, esteemed within his professional circles. --Times, London<br><br>Readers will know that they are in the presence of a searching and highly particular mind... Baxandall observes people sharply and is even harder on himself. His rare humor is as dry as blotting sand. Sly teasing of John Pope Hennessy, his undentable boss at the V&amp;A, is fun to read, though Baxandall admits it bounced off. The high points are the vivid evocation of his mentors, above all the literary critic F.R.Leavis who taught him as an undergraduate at Cambridge. Baxandall saw art the way that Leavis taught him to read book, less for pleasure than as 'judgments of life'. -- RA Magazine</p><h2>The Mental Game Plan</h2><p>Do you want to acquire that winning edge in sport?

The design of such ordinary items demonstrates the simple brilliance of human creativity, while at the same time showing the frustration of getting anything completely right. Nothing&#x2019;s perfect, and so the quest for perfection continues to continue.<br><br>In this engrossing and insightful book, Petroski takes us inside the creative process by which common objects are invented and improved upon in pursuit of the ever-elusive perfect thing. He shows us, for instance, how the disposable paper cup became a popular commercial success only after the public learned that shared water glasses could carry germs; how it took years, an abundance of business panache, and many discarded models&#x2013;from cups that opened like paper bags to those that came with pleats&#x2013;for the inventor of the paper cup to arrive at what we now use and toss away without so much as a thought for its fascinating history.<br><br>A trenchant, surprising evaluation of why some designs succeed and others don&#x2019;t, <b>Small Things Considered</b> is also an utterly delightful study of human nature.<br>Henry Petroski,<b> </b>the Aleksandar S.

When Bugsy Siegel was murdered, his henchman Mickey Cohen took over the criminal activity in Los Angeles. Mickey Cohen attained such power and dominance from the late 1940s until 1976 that he was a regular above-the-fold newspaper name, accumulating a remarkable count of more than 1,000 front-pages in Los Angeles papers alone, and was featured in hundreds of articles in national and international periodicals. His story and the history of mid-century L.A. are inextricably intertwined. Mickey Cohen is a seductive, premium-octane blend of true crime and Hollywood that spins around a wildly eccentric mob boss. Author Tere Tereba delivers tales of high life, high drama, and highly placed politicians, among them RFK and Richard Nixon, as well as revelations about countless icons, including Shirley Temple, Lana Turner, Frank Sinatra, and the Reverend Billy Graham.

Darlow and H. F. Moule, has proved of inestimable worth to librarians and bibliophiles. This Revised and Expanded edition of that original Catalogue devotes an exceptional amount of space and attention to English editions of Holy Scripture. Of these books, the Bible House Library possesses one of the most complete collections in existence and thus it was realized early on that this section of the Catalogue demanded an entire volume. It will be seen that enumerated here are nearly a thousand separate editions of the English Bible, or some part of it, published before the close of the eighteenth century. In order to exhibit the historical development as completely as possible, every issue of significance has been noted - even in the very few cases where such as issue was not represented in the Library. With regard to the bibliography, no pains were spared to give full descriptions, including the register of signatures, of all early editions.

But his workday is spent at a major Southern California clinic, treating the severest cases of drug dependency and psychiatric breakdown. In this riveting book, Pinsky reveals the intimate and often shocking stories of his patients as they struggle with emotional trauma, sexual abuse, and a host of chemical nemeses: alcohol, marijuana, Ecstasy, heroin, speed, cocaine, and prescription drugs. At the center of these stories is Pinsky himself, who immerses himself passionately, almost obsessively, in his work. From the sexually compulsive model to the BMW-driving soccer mom, Cracked exposes, in fast-moving, powerful vignettes, the true scope and severity of addiction, a nationwide epidemic.</p></p><p><p>One of the most listened-to doctors in America, Dr. Drew Pinsky is a practicing physician who is board certified in internal and addiction medicine. He is the executive producer and host of the hit VH1 reality series <em>Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew</em>, <em>Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House</em>, and <em>Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew</em>. On radio he is the host of the nationally syndicated program Love<em></em>line. He is the author of <em>Cracked: Putting Broken Lives Together Again</em> and <em>When Painkillers Become Dangerous</em>. Pinsky lives in Southern California with his wife, Susan, and their teenage triplets.</p>Throughout Pinsky's time hosting MTV's popular Loveline show-in which he and cohost Adam Carolla (The Dr. Drew and Adam Book) frankly answered teen questions about sex and drugs-Pinsky also ran the drug addiction rehab clinic at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. In this engaging and well-written memoir, he incorporates a frank description of his work with the "manipulative, secretive, frightened, paranoid and unstable" patients at Las Encinas, a single-story bungalow on 30 acres once used as a Hollywood backdrop (this is where W.C. Fields died and Ozzy Osborne's son recently spent time). Pinsky plays down the Tinseltown connection, preferring to look at his entire range of patients, who represent "every possible facet of society, from the rich to the destitute to the socially prominent to the disconnected." What they share are the typical hot buttons of trauma-"pain, abuse, neglect, abandonment"-and the attempt to ease the pain through drug addiction. Pinsky provides a hard-nosed look at the realities of a detox clinic, from the patients' physical illness and flashbacks to doctors' letdown when a patient quits the program and returns to addiction. Pinsky freely admits that he doesn't know why some people "get it" and stay sober while others can't; at the same time, he openly discusses his own problems ("I turned to rescuing other people the same way my patients turn to drugs and alcohol").<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>INTERSTELLAR PIG</h2><p>A teenager becomes interested in a strange board game called &#34;Interstellar Pig,&#34; the obsession of his new and unusual neighbors, and he soon stumbles into a nightmare when he discovers that the game is real.</p><p>"I typed my first story when I was six -- the beginning of my dependence on keyboards. It was called "The Fat Cat," and it read: "Once there was a fat cat. boy was she fat. Well, not that fat. But pretty fat." Even then, I needed an editor.<p>From that point on, I was always writing or composing something. And almost from the very beginning, I was fascinated by the grotesque and macabre. One of my first musical compositions was called "Guillotines in the Springtime." At school, when we were assigned to write a story about a holiday, I always cane up with something like "The Haunted Easter Egg."</p><p>In high school I continued writing poems and stories and composing music. When the school orchestra played one of my compositions at an assembly, everybody thought I was a genius. I did nothing to correct this impression. I went to Harvard, where I was miserable -- and wrote intensely tragic novellas, as well as music for student films and plays.. I also kept a voluminous journal, hundreds of single-spaced typed pages.. I gave them different volume titles like <i>Rats Live on No Evil Star</i>. (That's a palindrome.) I told that journal everything, and most of it is drivel. But it was a lot cheaper than going to a psychotherapist, and maybe I'll get some usable material out of it someday.</p><p>After college I spent a year in England, where I studied musical composition and worked as a pianist at the Royal Ballet School. It was there that I had the experiences which later became my first YA novel, <b>Blackbriar</b>. I really did live in the middle of a forest in an ancient cottage that once had been a pest house for people with small pocks. Because I was still keeping journal, I put all the details down on paper. Back in the States, I turned the journal into a book, and I was lucky -- because the manuscript was rejected by only one publisher. The second editor who saw it, Ann Durell at Dutton, liked it enough to work with me on it through a couple of drafts, until finally she felt it was good enough for publication and offered me a contract.</p><p>My second novel, <b>Run</b>, also took place in a house I had lived in. After that, I ran out of interesting real places to write about. I saw if I was going to make my living as a writer, I was going to have to begin making things up, using my imagination. The result was my first science fiction book, <b>House of Stairs</b>. Although I invented the plot and the setting, the characters in that book were all based on people I knew. I continue to use real people in my books, and that has gotten me into trouble at times. Fortunately, most of my friends have started speaking to me again.</p><p>Gradually, without much planning on it, I began drifting more and more into science fiction, a genre I had always loved. A lot of the fun of writing science fiction is learning about real scientific phenomena, like behavior modifications or black holes or the fourth dimension, and turning them into stories. The challenge is to try to make the parts you invent as believable as the scientific laws you are using. If you succeed, then you are giving the reader something that is magical and fantastic but at the same time might actually be possible.. That's the great thing about science fiction -- someday it could really happen.</p><p>For nine years, I also worked as a rehearsal pianist for the Boston Ballet, touring with them all over Europe and the United States, and composing three ballets that the company performed. (One of them was called <i>Incident at Blackbriar</i>, a nice plug for my book.) Eventually I quit because it was taking too much time away from my writing, and partly because the stressful atmosphere of a ballet company began to get to me. One of the best things about being a writer is that it's a job without a lot of stress. But I did keep notes of everything that happened: the time Giselle's house tipped over and knocked a dancer out cold, the time a dancer fell into the orchestra pit, what it was like to perform in ancient Roman amphitheaters in the rain, the kinds of things dancers say to each other onstage. I continue trying to turn it all into a book, and someday I may do it.</p><p>Now I live part of the year in Bangkok, Thailand, and part of the year in Boston. I write full- time and do a lot of serious cooking. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to make a living as a writer. I shouldn't ever run out of ideas -- knock on wood -- since the universe is full of great things like strange attractors and the Mandelbrot set. I still can't get over the fact that time slows down in the presence of a gravitational field. It really does, you know. That's not science fiction. It's a fact."</p><p>copyright ? 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Whilst in the army he began drawing cartoons and afterward studied art at the Cincinnati Art Academy and then the Cooper Union. It was after his first one-man exhibition at the Tanager Gallery, New York, that he became known as one of the leading figures in American Pop art. He subsequently abandoned abstract expressionism for collages and constructions in mixed media, producing works created from clocks, television sets and air conditioners to ressemble shop windows. He became well known for the overt erotic imagery of his series, Great American Nude, which became progressively more sexual during the 1970s. This monograph is both a visual retrospective and informed critical account of Tom Wesselmann&#39;s work.</p><p>This inaugural publication from the first museum devoted entirely to the work of a postwar American artist will be of interest to students of Warhol for the ephemera it documents. The maquettes of now-famous Warhol images and the previously unseen artifacts give further insight into the character of the artist and the breadth of his interests. However, in light of such archival publications as MOMA's Andy Warhol: A Retrospective (LJ 5/15/89) and The Warhol Diaries (Warner, 1989) and the fact that he is one of the most written-about artists of the century, this is a tertiary work. Most of the essays contained herein focus on the museum itself-its conception, financing, architecture, and significance as well as its contents. Though stolid, these glimpses into the machinations of a museum make this a requisite for academic libraries supporting curatorial and museum studies courses. Otherwise, this is essential only for comprehensive Warhol collections.

The American gallerist and curator Keith de Lellis's selection of more than 200 pictures, some previously unpublished, by more than 60 masters--including Mario Giacomelli, Nino Migliori, and Mario De Biasi--reveals the touching, the humorous, and the tragic in the day-to-day lives of the Italian people, liberated from the grips of Fascism.

It contains a cake for every occasion. For a fuss-free cake for afternoon coffee with friends, Cardamom-Scented Citrus Loaf or One-Bowl Chocolate Buttermilk Cake will do the trick (and can be mixed, assembled, and in the oven in less than ten minutes). These cakes are not hard to make. The recipes are straightforward, the ingredients commonly available, and the techniques geared toward the home baker. All have been field tested, which mean all of them work. And all follow well-recognized enlightened&#34;&#34; guidelines for healthy eating, including no more than 10 grams of fat per serving, utilization of healthy fats and oils, and incorporation of whole grains when possible. A nutritional analysis is included with every recipe, listing a breakdown of calories, protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sodium, and cholesterol per serving.&#34;&#34;</p><p>Life is filled with countless little pleasures--cake is one of the very best of them. <p>And why wait for a special occasion? A triple-tiered lemon curd cake may be ideal for a birthday f�te or bridal shower, but an impromptu batch of Mexican chocolate cupcakes is perfect for Sunday supper and a plum crumble cake is tops for teatime. </p><p>Now, armed with your copy of <i>Enlightened Cakes</i>, you can have your cake and eat it too, all with significantly less fat and fewer calories. </p><p>The development of lighter cakes for this collection---lower in fat and overall caloric content---took a considerable amount of testing and experimentation. While cutting back on butter and oil in cooking can be relatively simple, baking is a different story. With baking, each of the recipe's ingredients has a distinct, yet interdependent, role. Fat, in particular, lends cakes moisture, flavor and structure and cannot be reduced without altering the other ingredients of the recipe, as well as the assembly technique. </p><p>But take heart: lightening cakes is possible, and <i>Enlightened Cakes</i> is delicious proof. The recipes incorporate a variety of techniques and ingredient swaps for cutting back on fat and calories in a wide range of cakes. The goal was simple: create great cakes, all without compromising flavor and texture. The result is more than 100 irresistible cakes for every occasion. </p><p>Each recipe is unique and downright delectable; the results are every bit as irresistible as higher fat favorites--perhaps even more so. Moreover, each is a reminder that a cake needn't be complicated to be excellent. Whether you are a new or seasoned baker, you will find recipe after recipe that delivers impressive results, time and again. </p><p>There's even more to recommend these cakes. In every chapter you'll find plenty of nostalgic flavors--think chocolate, caramel, vanilla, spice, luscious fruits and, yes, butter--they're all here, just with lighter fat and calorie profiles. Included, too, are innovative twists and captivating new tastes, such as fresh herbs, bold spices, floral accents, even some sassy takes on those old favorites--all to provide you with an ever-growing number of contemporary options for your cake-baking pleasure. </p><p>Finally, <i>Enlightened Cakes</i> provides detailed ingredient information for stocking a cake-ready pantry, a list of different types and shapes of cake pans, and tips for storing your cake creations to preserve their flavor. Using the hints, your cake baking will be streamlined and stress-free. </p><p>This collection will inspire you to head to the kitchen to let the baking begin. The recipes will take you through every season of the year from more delicate spring and summer fruit favorites and deep into fall and winter entertaining with scads of spice-scented, pumpkin-plumped and cranberry-jeweled creations.</p>Camilla V.

Carey A. Moore combines his treatment of scholarly issues with an engaging explanation of the popular Jewish festival of Purim.<br><br>One of three biblical books named after women (Esther, Ruth, Judith), Esther reads like a novel, with its fast-paced, action-packed story. Drawing on ancient tales of court intrigue and midrashic sources, the author captivates the reader with the story of Queen Esther, her uncle Mordecai, King Xerxes, and the the royal court's villain, Haman. The story not only entertains, it also explains the origins of the Jewish festival of Purim.<br><br>Moore deftly deals with the scholarly issues peculiar to this book without sacrificing his sensitivity to its literary quality. The uncertainty that Esther should be included in sacred Scripture stems from its apparent lack of religious elements, its absence at Qumran, and its questionable historicity. Moore takes up these issues, carefully explaining and weighing prevailing scholarly theories before registering his own conclusions on the origin, date, and purpose of the book of Esther.<br><br>Carey A.

No matter how many hours he puts in, he can't meet everyone's needs. Steven seems to be forgetting that it's not his responsibility to fix all these hurts on his own--and that his family is suffering because he is working too hard. The dramatic and unexpected results at the church and at a local college reveal the true power of the Holy Spirit, and, in the end no one is ever the same after experiencing the Stirring.</p></p><p></p><h2>Shetland in the Shed (Animal Ark Series #20)</h2><p>When a friend goes into the hospital, Mandy and James take in his daughter Polly and her shetland pony, but the owners of Animal Ark Veterinary Clinic find they must teach her how to overcome a fear of horses.</p><p></p><h2>Bath Tangle</h2><p><br><br>When the Earl of Spenborough suddenly dies, his willful and obstinate daughter Serena is devastated.

And none other than the Marquis of Rotherham, an arrogant and fierce noble who used to be betrothed to Serena.<br><br>Now the marquis holds Serena's entire estate, knowing that the only way she can regain her inheritance is if she weds.... And only if the marquis gives his approval. But how can Serena trust a scoundrel to protect her happiness?<br><br></p><p>Lady Serena Carlow is an acknowledged beauty, but she's got a temper as fiery as her head of red hair. When her father dies unexpectedly, Serena discovers to her horror that she has been left a ward of Ivo Barrasford, marquis of Rotherham, a man whom Serena once jilted and who now has the power to give or withhold his consent to any marriage she might contemplate. With her father's heir eager to take over his inheritance--and Serena's lifelong home--she and her lovely young stepmother, Fanny, decide to move to Bath, where Serena makes an odd new friend and discovers an old love, Major Hector Kirkby. Before long, Serena, Fanny, Kirkby, and Rotherham are entangled in a welter of misunderstood emotions, mistaken engagements, and misdirected love. <p> Georgette Heyer's genius has always been in creating memorable characters, then placing them in a comedy of manners that is absolutely true to the Regency period. <i>Bath Tangle</i> is a delightful romp through the <i>haute ton</i> of early-19th-century England, and the battling, passionate, meant-for-each-other Ivo and Serena are one of her most successful romantic duos.</p>Georgette Heyer's novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades.

A death omen. It doesn&#x2019;t get much worse than that.</p><p>We hadn&#x2019;t planted them. When a gardener suggested it once, my mother had said, &#x201c;They make opium from poppies,&#x201d; in whis- pered horror, as if her society friends might jump to the conclusion we were running an opium den in our basement. I&#x2019;d wanted to laugh and tell her they used a different subspecies for drugs. I hadn&#x2019;t. Deep in my gut, I had not wanted poppies in our garden.</p><p>A silly superstition. Or so it seemed. But when I see omens and portents, they mean something.</p><p>It&#x2019;d been three weeks since I&#x2019;d left my family home, fleeing ahead of the media frenzy that erupted when I&#x2019;d learned my real parents were notorious serial killers. While I worked on building a new life, I&#x2019;d decided to come back to the empty house and grab a few things. I&#x2019;d tossed my suitcases in the borrowed Buick and headed out back for a swim. I was walking toward the front of the house, raking my fingers through my wet hair, when I noticed a splash of red in the rock garden.</p><p>Poppies.</p><p>I reached down and rubbed a silky red petal. It felt real enough. I took out my phone, snapped a picture, and checked the result. Yep, I still saw poppies. Which meant they existed outside my head. Always a good sign.</p><p>Except for the part about poppies being a&nbsp;bad&nbsp;sign. I shook it off, turned the corner, and&#x2014;</p><p>There was someone sitting in my driver&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>I flashed to the poppies. A killer waiting to ambush me? Three weeks ago this would have been laughable. That was before I discovered the truth about my past.</p><p>Still, I couldn&#x2019;t imagine an assassin waiting, in plain view, in my car. Nor would anyone sneak onto the estate to steal a fifteen-year-old Buick when a half-dozen antique sports cars were garaged around back.</p><p>The most likely explanation these days? A reporter getting creative.</p><p>I continued forward, circling around the car. I&#x2019;d left the driver&#x2019;s window down. A woman sat behind the wheel. The roof cast her face into deep shadow and all I could see were sunglasses and blond hair. Ash-blond, like my own. It even looked like my current cut&#x2014;a few inches long, tousled-curly.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said as I walked closer.</p><p>The woman didn&#x2019;t respond. I grabbed the handle, yanked open the door, and&#x2014;</p><p>She fell out. Toppled, as I jumped back with a yelp, thinking even as I did that I was making a fool of myself, that someone was snapping a picture of this very juvenile prank&#x2014;</p><p>She had no eyes.</p><p>The woman hung out of the car, wig falling off, sunglasses, too. Beneath the sunglasses were blood-crusted pits.</p><p>I staggered back, my own eyes shutting fast.</p><p>I was hallucinating. I&#x2019;d seen this twice before, first on a dead man and then on a woman in the hospital. Both times, it was nothing more than a hallucination, an omen with some meaning I couldn&#x2019;t comprehend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I looked again, she&#x2019;d be fine. I did, and&#x2014;</p><p>Her eyes were still gone. Gouged out. Dried blood smeared down one cheek.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not hallucinating. This time, I&#x2019;m not hallucinating.</p><p>I bent to touch her neck. The skin was cold.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a dead woman in my car. A dead woman dressed to look like me.</p><p>I raced to the house, fumbling with the lock. The door opened. I swung in, hit the security code, then slammed and locked it. I reset the alarms, fished my gun and cell from my bag, and made a call.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I paced the hall waiting for the sound of a car in the drive. As I passed the front room, I caught a movement through the drawn sheers. I nudged one aside and peeked out to see a dark shape by the gardens. A big black dog&#x2014;exactly like one I&#x2019;d seen early this morning, fifty miles away in Cainsville.</p><p>The hounds will come to Cainsville and when they do, you&#x2019;ll wish you&#x2019;d made a very different choice today.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what Edgar Chandler said yesterday, before the police took him away, arrested for his involvement in two murders that had been pinned on my birth parents. Only a few people knew I&#x2019;d rented an apartment in Cainsville, and he wasn&#x2019;t one of them. After the media had swarmed, I&#x2019;d taken refuge in that sleepy little village in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>A sleepy little village with disappearing gargoyles, vicious ravens and, as of this morning, gigantic black hounds.</p><p>A sleepy little village where no one seemed to find it the least bit strange that I could read omens and see portents.</p><p>I rubbed my arms. I didn&#x2019;t want to see a connection between Chandler and Cainsville. I loved my new town. I loved the safety of it, the community of it, the way it had welcomed me and made me feel like I belonged.</p><p>I peeked out again. The dog was still there, and it was exactly as I remembered from this morning&#x2014;a massive beast, over three feet tall, with shaggy black fur.</p><p>There was no way the dog could have followed me fifty miles. Yet what were the chances of seeing another just like it?</p><p>I took out my phone. As the camera clicked, the dog looked straight at me. Then it loped off across the lawn and disappeared through the trees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few minutes later, I caught the roar of a familiar engine and ran outside as a black Jag screeched to a stop. The door flew open. A man jumped out, ducking to avoid hitting his head.</p><p>Gabriel Walsh. Roughly thirty years old&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never asked his age. At least six foot four&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never measured him, either. A linebacker&#x2019;s build, with wavy black hair, strong features, dark shades, and a custom-tailored suit, despite the fact it was Memorial Day and he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be working. He was, of course. Gabriel was always working.</p><p>When I first met my mother&#x2019;s former appeal lawyer, I&#x2019;d mistaken him for hired muscle. A thug in an expensive suit. Three weeks later, I still thought the analogy wasn&#x2019;t a bad one.</p><p>He&nbsp;did&nbsp;have a reputation for ripping people apart, though usually only on witness stands.&nbsp;Usually.</p><p>Gabriel didn&#x2019;t even look at my car&#x2014;or the corpse spilling out of it. His gaze shot straight to me, lips tightening as he bore down. Limped down, I should say. He&#x2019;d been shot in the leg yesterday. And no, I didn&#x2019;t do it, as tempting as that could be sometimes.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your cane?&#x201d; I called. &#x201c;I told you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;to stay in the house. I only came out when I saw you drive up.&#x201d; A grunt. A quick once-over. Then, &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; His voice tinged with reluctance, as if he really hated to ask.&nbsp;Ah, Gabriel.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And no, I didn&#x2019;t call the police.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His shades swung toward the Buick. He started for it. If I&#x2019;d been anyone else, he would have ordered me to stay back. Not because he wouldn&#x2019;t want to upset a client&#x2014;such considerations aren&#x2019;t given space in Gabriel&#x2019;s busy brain. He&#x2019;d insist because otherwise that client might get in his way or do something stupid, like leave fingerprints. As of yesterday, though, I wasn&#x2019;t just a client. He&#x2019;d hired me as an investigative assistant, which damned well better mean I could be trusted near a potential crime scene.</p><p>I did hang back a few paces. Steeling myself for the sight. I didn&#x2019;t want to flinch in front of him.</p><p>He reached the driver&#x2019;s side. Stopped. Frowned. Lifted his shades. Lowered them. Looked at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you . . . ?&#x201d; He trailed off and shook his head. &#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;</p><p>I rounded the car to where he stood by the open driver&#x2019;s door. The body . . .</p><p>The body was gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;I saw . . .&#x201d; I swallowed. &#x201c;I saw someone in the car, and when I opened the door, the body fell out. I wasn&#x2019;t imagining it. I touched it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you did. The question is . . .&#x201d;</p><p>He looked around and I moved closer, leaning into the open doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no blood,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But the only injury I could see was her eyes. And she was cold, really cold. She hadn&#x2019;t died recently.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. I didn&#x2019;t see any doubt in his expression, but my heart still pounded, my brain whirring to prove that I hadn&#x2019;t imagined it. No, that I hadn&#x2019;t&nbsp;hallucinated&nbsp;it.</p><p>&#x201c;Poppies,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There are poppies in the rock garden. I saw them right before I found the body.&#x201d;</p><p>I hurried around the garage with Gabriel limping after me. There were no poppies in the rock garden.</p><p>&#x201c;I took a picture to make sure I wasn&#x2019;t imagining them,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There were clearly&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>My photo showed the garden. With rocks. And ivy. And moss. And no poppies.</p><p>&#x201c;They were&nbsp;there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I swear&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I questioning that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then stop panicking.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are. You found a body, and you called me, and now it&#x2019;s gone, and you&#x2019;re panicking because you can&#x2019;t prove it was there. I don&#x2019;t doubt you saw something. We&#x2019;ll figure out what it was.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I led Gabriel to the sitting room, his gaze flitted around, discreetly checking out the antiques, any one of which would pay the annual rent on my new apartment.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, this is what I walked away from,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I know how you feel about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re thinking something.&#x201d; &#x201c;Only that it&#x2019;s a very nice house.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriel knows what it&#x2019;s like to be poor, having been raised by a drug-addicted pickpocket mother who&#x2019;d disappeared when he was fifteen, leaving him to survive on his own. A street kid who put himself through law school. So no, he was not impressed by the debutante who walked away from her Kenilworth mansion to work in a diner in Cainsville.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you collect your things?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I did, including my laptop, so you can have your old one back. Don&#x2019;t worry, though, I&#x2019;ll pay rent for the full week.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled, but he only nodded. I walked to the love seat. My dad&#x2019;s spot, where we used to sit together. As I sank into it, I began to relax.</p><p>Gabriel stopped beside my mother&#x2019;s chair, a spindly antique. &#x201c;That is not going to hold you,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Does it hold anyone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Barely. Lovely to look at, but hellishly uncomfortable to sit on.&#x201d; He surveyed the others. They all seemed made for people about six</p><p>inches shorter than Gabriel.</p><p>I stood. &#x201c;Take this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sit. Put your leg up. You&#x2019;re supposed to keep it elevated.&#x201d;</p><p>He grumbled but lowered himself onto the love seat and turned sideways to prop up his leg, proving it was hurting more than he&#x2019;d let on.</p><p>I perched on my mother&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;So apparently I hallucinated a dead body.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I think we do. Otherwise, someone left a corpse in my car while I went for a swim and then disposed of it while I was in the house waiting for you. Highly unlikely. The fact that she wore a wig to look like me only seems to seal the matter. It was an omen. A warning.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;I prefer poppies.&#x201d;</p><p>A faint frown. &#x201c;If it was indeed an apparition, would it not make more sense that you would see&nbsp;yourself&nbsp;dead in the car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I see whatever my mind will accept.&#x201d;</p><p>When he didn&#x2019;t reply, I glanced over. He had his shades off as he stared at the wall, deep in thought. The first time I&#x2019;d seen Gabriel without his sunglasses, I&#x2019;d wished he&#x2019;d put them back on. His eyes were an unnaturally pale blue. Empty eyes, I&#x2019;d thought. I&#x2019;d come to see that &#x201c;empty&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t quite the right word. More like iced over. Still startling, though, that pale blue ringed with dark. I&#x2019;d been with him many times when he&#x2019;d removed his shades in front of strangers, and no one else seemed bothered by his eyes. I wondered what they saw. And, if it was different for me, why?</p><p>&#x201c;So you spotted the poppies and then the body,&#x201d; he said after a moment. &#x201c;That seems an overload of omens.&#x201d;</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t asking. Just working it out for himself. I swore he was more comfortable with my &#x201c;ability&#x201d; than I was. His great-aunt Rose was a psychic in Cainsville, and he&#x2019;d grown up accepting things like the second sight.</p><p>&#x201c;Would it not seem that the poppies were a portent&nbsp;for&nbsp;the body?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Meaning the body itself was real?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. The eyes . . . Well, I told you about the eyes. What I didn&#x2019;t mention is that I&#x2019;ve seen that before. Twice in the past few weeks.&#x201d; I explained and then said, &#x201c;Both times it was a hallucination. Which seems to prove that this wasn&#x2019;t real, either, and that I shouldn&#x2019;t have called you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That is&nbsp;always&nbsp;the first thing you should do under such circumstances.&#x201d; He said it as if his clients found corpses in cars all the time. &#x201c;You came inside to call, and secured the house, correct?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Correct,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you hear any noise from outside?&#x201d;</p><p>I started to shake my head. Then I remembered the hound and pulled out my cell phone, certain I&#x2019;d see a photo of our empty front gardens. I didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I passed him my phone. &#x201c;What do you see?&#x201d; He looked at the screen. &#x201c;A dog.&#x201d;</p><p>I exhaled in relief.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that an omen?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea. But I saw that exact same dog in Cainsville this morning. I&#x2019;m sure it was the same one. It&#x2019;s huge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And very distinctive.&#x201d; He tapped the phone, frowning. &#x201c;In Cainsville, you say?&#x201d; He rose. &#x201c;We should speak to Rose.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before we left, I reset the house alarm.</p><p>&#x201c;You need one of those at your apartment,&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;I have a gun. And a cat.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave me a look.</p><p>&#x201c;I cannot afford a security system, Gabriel. I suppose I could hock some things. I left most of my jewelry upstairs. I could go get it . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;d be lucky to get a fraction of the value.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m sure Gabriel had enough experience with pawnshops to know, though most of what he would have hocked as a youth wouldn&#x2019;t have been his to begin with.</p><p>&#x201c;You need a security system,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;One of Don&#x2019;s men installs excellent units at very reasonable prices.&#x201d; He meant Don Gallagher, his primary client. Don headed the Satan&#x2019;s Saints. It was not a heavy metal band.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh. A biker who installs security systems? Does he keep a &#x2018;backup&#x2019; copy of the code?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Petty larceny is hardly profitable enough for the Saints to bother with&#x2014;if they involved themselves in criminal activity, which they do not. Any system I buy from them would be both secure and afford- able.&#x201d;</p><p>Having survived that fall off the back of a truck without a scratch. &#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t afford&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll deduct it from your pay. Now, I seem to recall you saying once that your father had a garage full of cars?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should take one.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a look.&#x201d;</p><p>He limped off, leaving me to follow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gabriel scanned the two rows of cars.

Hope for a peaceful future is not enough to cont with history. In Ulster, history has vanquished hope so often that it seems an act of folly to expect it to be otherwise. Until recently, the crisis in Northern Ireland was deemed a problem without a solution. Now that the major antagonists have agreed to work for peace and democracy, it is time for an authoritative assessment of "the troubles" that have plagued Ulster for more than a quarter century.<br><br>A Belfast product of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, Jack Holland is both of and above the fray; he is the writer who has stayed close to the terrorists and antiterrorists of every persuasion since 1966. In this cogent and balanced history, he unravels the complex and often misunderstood story of "the troubles," offering an insightful look at the past, a thorough vision of the present, and a glimpse of what the future may hold.<br><br></p><p><i>"If you are not confused, you don't understand the situation."</i><p> So said a Belfast graffito of the late 1970s--a hauntingly accurate comment on the political violence that has raged in Northern Ireland for generations. The causes of that violence are complex, and all but impenetrable to outsiders: it has something to do with religion, something to do with economics, something to do with politics, and very much to do with memory and history, along with the local penchant for remembering wrongs and rights for years and years after the actual events.</p><p> New York-based journalist and historian Jack Holland, whose ancestors are Northern Irish, Catholic and Protestant both, does much to clarify the confusion with <i>Hope Against History</i>. He writes of the Troubles over the last 30-odd years, a time when militant forces favoring continued union with Great Britain battled those seeking union with the Republic, a battle that quickly degenerated into terrorist warfare that killed far more innocents than combatants. It took too long, and too many lives, before both sides began to see the wisdom of abandoning this senseless sectarian violence for a political solution; the slow evolution of that view takes up much of Holland's detailed narrative. Holland gladly gives credit to opposing political leaders such as Gerry Adams and Gary McMichael for recognizing that each side had a role in determining Northern Ireland's future. He also credits the Clinton administration for its efforts in the peace process--efforts, he suggests, that arose from Clinton's wanting to garner support among conservative American Catholics, but that soon transcended narrow political interest.</p><p> As Holland notes, the details of that solution are far from being settled. Still, he suggests, there is plenty of reason to hope that the Northern Irish people, of whatever heritage, will soon find a way out of violence and get on with the work of living together. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br>Jack Holland writes for the <i>Irish Echo</i> and teaches journalism at NYU. A poet and novelist, he is a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times</i> and co-wrote the 1998 PBS documentary D<i>aughters of the Troubles</i>; his last book, <i>Phoenix: Policing the Shadows</i>, about counterintelligence activities in Ulster, was a best-seller in Britain and Ireland. <br><br></p><h2>Grotesque</h2><p>Two prostitutes have been murdered in Tokyo. Yuriko had been working as a prostitute all her adult life, starting while still at school, where her stunning beauty compensated for what she lacked in intellect and commanded attention from older men. Kazue worked for a blue-chip company and had good career prospects, but was unpopular with colleagues and felt isolated. She chose to walk the streets at night where she hoped to get noticed. Twenty years previously both women were educated at an elite school for young ladies, and both exhibited exceptional promise prior to their brutal, unnecessary deaths. How and why did this tragedy occur? With narration from Yuriko&#39;s embittered, unattractive sister and through the girls&#39; journals and diaries Kirino allows their shocking story to unfurl. As with &#34;Out&#34;, &#34;Grotesque&#34; gets under the skin, and Kirino&#39;s analysis of the female psyche grips the reader. The extreme need to succeed, and the vicious desire to be accepted in the bewildering environment of modern life is explored here with acute and chilling insight. &#34;Grotesque&#34; is a masterful and haunting achievement.</p><p>Natsuo Kirino, born in 1951, is the author of sixteen novels, four short-story collections, and an essay collection. She is the recipient of six of Japan&#39;s premier literary awards, including the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for Out, and the Izumi Kyoka Prize for Literature for Grotesque. Her work has been translated into nineteen languages, and several of her books have been turned into movies. Out was the first of her novels to appear in English and was nominated for an Edgar Award. She lives in Tokyo.<b>Chapter One: A Chart of Phantom Children</b><br><br>Whenever I meet a man, I catch myself wondering what our child would look like if we were to make a baby. It&#x2019;s practically second nature to me now. Whether he&#x2019;s handsome or ugly, old or young, a picture of our child flashes across my mind. My hair is light brown and feathery fine, and if his is jet black and coarse, then I predict our child&#x2019;s hair will be the perfect texture and color. Wouldn&#x2019;t it? I always start out imagining the best possible scenarios for these children, but before long I&#x2019;ve conjured up horrific visions from the very opposite end of the spectrum.<br><br>What if his scraggly eyebrows were plastered just above my eyes with their distinctive double lids? Or what if his huge nostrils were notched into the end of my delicate nose? His bony kneecaps on my robustly curved legs, his square toenails on my highly arched foot? And while this is going through my mind, I&#x2019;m staring holes in the man, so of course he&#x2019;s convinced that I have a thing for him. I can&#x2019;t tell you how many times these encounters have ended in embarrassing misunderstandings. But still, in the end my curiosity always gets the best of me.<br><br>When a sperm and an egg unite, they create an entirely new cell&#x2014;and so a new life begins. These new beings enter the world in all kinds of shapes and sizes. But what if, when the sperm and the egg unite, they are full of animosity for each other? Wouldn&#x2019;t the creature they produce be contrary to expectation and abnormal as a result? On the other hand, if they have a great affinity for each other, their offspring will be even more splendid than they are. Of that there can be no doubt. And yet, who can ever know what kind of intentions a sperm and an egg harbor when they meet?<br><br>It&#x2019;s at times like these that the chart of my hypothetical children flashes across my mind. You know the kind of chart: the sort you would find in biology or earth science textbooks. You remember them, don&#x2019;t you, the kind that reconstructs the hypothetical shape and characteristics of an extinct creature based on fossils discovered deep in the earth? Almost always these charts include full-color illustrations of plants and beasts, either in the sea or against the sky. Actually, ever since I was a child I was terrified of those illustrations because they made the imaginary appear real. I hated opening those textbooks so much, it became my habit to search out the page with those charts first and scrutinize them. Perhaps this proves that we are attracted to what frightens us.<br><br>I can still remember the artist&#x2019;s re-creation of the Burgess Shale fauna. Derived from the Cambrian fossils discovered in the Canadian Rockies, the chart is full of preposterous creatures swimming around in the sea. The <i>Hallucigenia</i> crawls along the sediment on the ocean floor, so many spines sticking out of its back you might mistake the creature for a hairbrush; and then there&#x2019;s the five-eyed <i>Opabinia</i> curling and contorting its way around rocks and crags. The <i>Anomalocaris</i>, with its giant hook-shaped forelimbs, prowls through the dark seas in search of prey. My own fantasy chart is close to this one. It shows children swimming through the water&#x2014;the bizarre children I have produced from my phantom unions with men.<br><br>For some reason I never think about the act that men and women perform to produce these children. When I was young my classmates would make fun of boys they didn&#x2019;t like by saying things such as, &#x201c;Just the very idea of touching him makes my skin crawl!&#x201d; But I never thought about it. I would skip the part about the sex act and go right to the children and the way they would turn out. Perhaps you can say I&#x2019;m a little peculiar in that regard!<br><br>If you look closely you&#x2019;ll notice that I&#x2019;m &#x201c;half.&#x201d; My father is a Swiss national of Polish descent. They say his grandfather was a minister who moved to Switzerland to escape the Nazis and then died there. My father was in the trade business, an importer of Western-style confections. His line of work might sound impressive, but in fact the products he imported were poor-quality chocolates and cookies, nothing more than cheap snacks. He might have been known for these Western-style sweets, but when I was growing up he never once let me eat one of his products.<br><br>We lived very frugally. Our food, clothes, and even my school goods were all made in Japan. I didn&#x2019;t go to an international school but attended Japanese public elementary schools. My allowance was strictly supervised, and even the money allotted for household expenses fell short of what my mother felt was adequate.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t so much that my father decided to spend the rest of his life in Japan with my mother and me. He was just too miserly to do otherwise. He refused to spend a single cent unnecessarily. And he, of course, was the one who determined what was and wasn&#x2019;t necessary.<br><br>To prove my point, my father kept a mountain cabin in Gunma Prefecture where we spent the weekends. He liked to fish and just put his feet up while he was there. For the evening meal it was our custom to have <i>bigos</i>, prepared just the way he liked it. <i>Bigos</i> is a Polish country-style stew made of sauerkraut, vegetables, and meat. My Japanese mother hated fixing it, of that there can be little doubt. When my father&#x2019;s business failed and he took the family back to Switzerland, I hear my mother cooked Japanese white rice every night and my father scowled each time she set it on the table. I stayed behind in Japan by myself, so I can&#x2019;t be sure, but I suspect that was my mother&#x2019;s revenge on my father for his <i>bigos</i>&#x2014;or, on second thought, for his stingy selfishness.<br><br>My mother told me that she once worked for my father&#x2019;s company. I used to indulge in romantic visions of a tender love blooming between the young foreign owner of a small company and the local girl who worked for him. But in fact, as the story goes, my mother had been married before, and when that didn&#x2019;t work out she returned home to Ibaraki Prefecture. She worked as a maid in my father&#x2019;s house, and that is how they met.<br><br>I had wanted to ask my mother&#x2019;s father to give me more details, but now it&#x2019;s too late. He&#x2019;s senile and has forgotten everything. In my grandfather&#x2019;s mind, my mother is still alive and remains a cute little girl in middle school; my father, my younger sister, and I do not even exist.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s Caucasian, and I suppose you could describe him as small-framed. He isn&#x2019;t particularly attractive, but he isn&#x2019;t ugly either. A Japanese person who met my father would have a difficult time trying to pick him out on a European street, that much is certain. Just as all &#x201c;Orientals&#x201d; look the same to whites, to an Oriental, my father was just your typical white man.<br><br>Shall I describe his features? His skin is white with a ruddy touch. His eyes are memorable for being a faded, mournful blue. In a flash they can gleam with cruel intensity. From a physical standpoint his most attractive feature is his shiny brown hair with its brilliant golden luster. It&#x2019;s now gone white, I suppose, and balding at the crown. He wears somber-hued business suits. If you ever see a middle-aged white man wearing a beige button-up raincoat even in the dead of winter, that would be my father.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s Japanese is good enough for an average conversation, and there was a time when he loved my Japanese mother. When I was little he would always say, &#x201c;When your dad came to Japan he planned on going home as soon as he could. But he was struck by a bolt of lightning that left him paralyzed and unable to return. That lightning was your mother, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>I think it&#x2019;s the truth. Well, I think it <i>was</i> the truth. My father and mother fed my sister and me on a diet of romantic dreams just as though they were giving us candy. Gradually the dreams wore thin, until in the end they wasted away to nothing. I&#x2019;ll tell that story in due course.<br><br>The way I saw my mother when I was little and the way I see her now are completely different. When I was little I was convinced that there wasn&#x2019;t a woman more beautiful than she in all the world. Now that I&#x2019;ve grown up, I realize that she was just average-looking, and not particularly attractive even for a Japanese. Her head was large and her legs short; her face was flat and her physique poor. Her eyes and nose crowded her face for space, her teeth stuck out, and she had a weak character. She yielded to my father in everything.<br><br>My father controlled my mother. If my mother ever talked back he would lash out at her with a volley of words. Mother was not smart; in fact, she was a born loser. Oh? Do you think I&#x2019;m being too critical? It never even occurred to me. Why am I so unforgiving when it comes to my mother? Let&#x2019;s just keep that question in mind as we go along, shall we?<br><br>The one I really want to talk about is my sister. I had a sister who was a year younger than me. Her name was Yuriko. I have no idea how best to describe her, but if I were to come up with one word, it would be <i>monster</i>. She was terrifyingly beautiful. You may doubt that a person can be so beautiful that she is monstrous. Being beautiful is far preferable to being ugly, after all&#x2014;at least that&#x2019;s the general consensus. I wish I could give people who hold that opinion just one glimpse of Yuriko.<br><br>People who saw Yuriko were first overwhelmed by how gorgeous she was. But gradually her absolute beauty would grow tiresome, and before long they would find her very presence&#x2014;with her perfect features&#x2014;unnerving. If you think I&#x2019;m exaggerating, the next time I&#x2019;ll bring you a photo. I&#x2019;ve felt the same way about her all my life, even though I was her older sister. I have no doubt you&#x2019;ll agree too.<br><br>Occasionally I have this ...</p><h2>Nothing Daunted: The Unexpected Education of Two Society Girls in the West (Thorndike press large print biography)</h2><p>A full-length account based on an admired New Yorker article traces the experiences of classmates Dorothy Woodruff and Rosamond Underwood, who in 1916 left their affluent New York lives to teach school on the western frontier.

So he took the name of his strip from the Latin phrase for &#34;it does not follow&#34; and created a comic that features no central character or theme, no setting or time frame, just a Twilight Zone of cartoon moments. Day after day, Non Sequitur hilariously jabs at the feats and foibles of life, skewering everyone from doctors to politicians. Wiley&#39;s irreverent, satirical wit, combined with his superbly crafted illustrations, confirms once and for all that the universe is one big joke at humanity&#39;s expense.In Wiley&#39;s world, no one is a better target than lawyers. That&#39;s why The Legal Lampoon, a collection of the cream of Non Sequitur&#39;s legal cartoon crop, will be one of the Wiley&#39;s most popular books.Consider the poor panhandler standing next to a signboard that reads, &#34;Stood on principle. Won my lawsuit. Went bankrupt.&#34; Or the Master of Spin, responding to his client&#39;s lost appeal to the parole board: &#34;Congratulations! You&#39;ve been held over by popular demand . . .&#34; Or a fund-raiser who can&#39;t get any donations until she edits her sign to read: &#34;Donations to spay and neuter stray pets and lawyers.&#34; Throughout the pages of The Legal Lampoon, lawyers get a royal roasting. It&#39;s a hilarious collection that will appeal to everyone who both reviles and respects lawyers. Yes, it&#39;s true: Many lawyers let Wiley know how much they appreciate his attorney humor. It&#39;s a book made in legal heaven.</p><p>Wiley began his career as a political cartoonist in 1976, and his incisive drawings have won him several honors, including the presitious Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award in 1991. Realizing there was more to life than politics, he left the big city and editorial cartooning in 1992 for Iowa City, Iowa, to devote his full warped attention to Non Sequitur. Non Sequitur is the only cartoon to win Reuben Awards in both the comic strip and comic panel categories and the only one to win a Reuben in its first year of syndication. Wiley now lives in Santa Barbara, Calif., with his wife and two daughters.</p><h2>Dicks and Deedees (Love and Rockets)</h2><p><b><i>Love and Rockets</i>' most popular characters in a new hardcover collection</b>. Armed with a passion for pop culture and punk rock, Jaime Hernandez (along with his brothers, Gilbert and Mario) was one of the first comic book artists to give a voice to minorities and women in the medium's 70-year history. His character-driven stories primarily explore the life of a three-dimensional Mexican-American woman from a fictional barrio of Los Angeles, Maggie Chascarillo, one of the most complex and recognizable characters in the history of Mexican-American fiction. Hernandez is the co-creator of <i>Love &amp; Rockets</i>, which along with <i>RAW</i> magazine defined the modern literary comics movement of the post-underground generation and celebrated its 20th anniversary this year. This first new Jaime Hernandez book since the splashy return of <i>Love and Rockets</i> in 2001 spotlights a wide-ranging and funky group of stories from L&amp;R and Hernandez's comic <i>Penny Century</i>. The continuing trials and tribulations of Maggie and Hopey are featured in "Election Day," "Everybody Loves Me, Baby" (featuring extensive flashbacks to their early punk days, a reader's favorite) and the surreal dream story "The Race." We also check up with Maggie's ex-boyfriend Ray D., who is the recipient of a series of increasingly rude surprises when his old buddy Doyle shows up, somewhat the worse for wear, in "The Frog Mouth." Plus "Bay of Threes," which chronicles the romance of Penny Century and H.R. Costigan from (virtually) cradle to grave. 96 pages b/w illustrations.</p><p>Jaime Hernandez is an internationally acclaimed, award-winning cartoonist and a lifelong Los Angelean.Hernandez has drawn his alternative-comics stories about a group of women in the Los Angeles barrio for more than two decades, yet he continues to be capable of revealing new aspects of his characters. Coming to terms with the past is the unstated theme of this collection, whose centerpiece, "The Race," is a dream story in which primary heroine Maggie rehashes her misgivings about her life. Elsewhere, Maggie's downbeat celebration of the end of her brief marriage is juxtaposed with a flashback to the couple's first encounters as punks in the early 1980s. Bringing out the backstory continues in a tale following bombshell Peggy Century from a childhood encounter with her future husband--the mysterious, horned millionaire H. R. Costigan--to his recent funeral. A too-brief story about Ray Dominguez, a former boyfriend of both Maggie and Penny who is fast becoming Hernandez's most sympathetic character, caps the volume. If the narrative gets more compelling and the characterizations grow richer with every passing year, Hernandez's elegantly simple drawing style remains his greatest strength. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Bober is the author of numerous books of history for young readers, including <i>Countdown to Independence: A Revolution of Ideas in England and Her American Colonies 1760-1776</i> and <i>Abigail Adams: Witness to a Revolution</i>.</p>Grade 7 Up Jefferson has been briefly described in a number of series biographies, especially for younger grades, but he has, surprisingly, been neglected as a subject for young adults. Bober's excellent biography does more than fill that gap. She presents a portrait of a very human, immensely gifted man who lived at the critical time of the formation of the American polity. An insatiable reader, he absorbed the learning of his time (happily the period of Enlightened thinking) and directed his energies to the law, the government, and the arts of living. His achievements in public life as well as in the private sphere were equally impressive. But Bober does not spare readers the sorrows and griefs of his family life, the criticisms leveled against his public policies, or the self-doubts, financial troubles, and sometimes tempestuous but always honorable emotional life of this charming man. Using Jefferson's own writings, quotations from contemporaries, documents and historical data, she has constructed a marvelously readable and informative biography that breathes life into an ``American hero'' and shows him as the person he must have been.

Furious at the turn of events, Adolf Hitler, <i>Il Duce</i>'s sworn ally, promised to rescue Mussolini and restore the Rome-Berlin Axis. On September 12, a small convoy of glider aircraft suddenly began crash-landing near the hotel-prison where Mussolini was held and German commandos poured out of the half-wrecked planes. The soldiers quickly overwhelmed the hotel and seized Mussolini, who had watched the drama unfold from a second-story window. "I knew my friend Adolf Hitler would not abandon me," said a grinning Mussolini to his rescuers. Hitler's rescue of Mussolini was one of the most famous commando operations of the twentieth century and shocked a war-weary world. It was also the dramatic culmination of the bizarre relationship between Hitler and Mussolini-a relationship that had disastrous consequences for the globe. In this vivid and lively narrative filled with drama, intrigue, action, and some of history's most notorious characters, author Greg Annussek recounts the dramatic story of Germany's secret six-week operation to find and rescue the prisoner Mussolini and restore him to power.</p><p><b>Greg Annussek</b> is the author of several books and a lifelong student of history.

Three laws in Deuteronomy command violence against a family member--the enemy in the household--who leads others away from covenantal obligations to God. This book examines such &#34;constructive&#34; violence carried out to protect the covenant community by investigating the reading practices of ancient Jewish and Christian interpreters of Scripture and their applications of these passages. It also helps modern readers approach biblical texts that command violence in the family, providing a model for the ethical interpretation of these difficult texts.</p><p>"Ancient and modern interpreters have struggled to understand and apply the passages in Deuteronomy that legislate violence against family members as judgment for covenant unfaithfulness. Caryn Reeder sorts through the Old Testament texts as well as the pertinent literatures of Hellenistic Judaism, Roman-period Jewish writers, the Tannaitic Rabbis, and the New Testament, offering meticulous analysis that helps modern readers understand the theological and cultural issues as well as the interpretive dilemmas. It is the rare scholar who can interact with these literatures so adeptly, but Reeder shows sophisticated insight at every turn. The Bible's call for constructive family violence is of great interest both in academia and the church, and Reeder's balanced treatment provides much-needed perspective to the discussion."<br>--<b>John H. Walton</b>, Wheaton College<br><br>"Reeder offers us an in-depth study of the laws of 'constructive family violence' in the book of Deuteronomy. She contributes to our interpretive lens by means of an ethnographically sensitive exegesis of these laws in Deuteronomy as well as a thorough review of their conceptualization in subsequent believing communities. Here is a very helpful resource for those engaged in the study of family law, the marking of social boundaries in Israel, and even church discipline."<br>--<b>Sandra L. Richter</b>, Wesley Biblical Seminary<br><br>"Caryn Reeder is unafraid. She is unafraid of a subject on which many fear to speak. She is unafraid of parts of the Bible that others either ignore or expunge.

Yes, it's still growing, high up in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Like a unique biological time-line, <i>While a Tree Was Growing </i>juxtaposes the life of a single tree with a chronology of world events to narrate 3,500 years of history, natural science, anthropology, and more. Large, generously illustrated two-page spreads are flanked by columns, with historic milestones on the left and a growth chart recording the tree�s progress on the right. Stitched into the middle of the book is a fold-out 11O x 33O poster. Illustrated by Daniel O'Leary.</p><p>High on the western slopes of California's Sierra Nevada grows the giant sequoia. Called wawonas and moguchi by Native Americans, the "big ones" by European settlers, and Sequoia-dendron giganteum by scientists, they are the largest trees in the world and among the oldest of all living things.<p> From science writer Jane Bosveld comes the story of one giant sequoia. We are there for its chancy beginnings as a seedling over three thousand years ago; we chart its magnificent growth-first straight up, to claim a piece of the crowded forest sky, and then out to diameter the equivalent of forty people holding hands in a ring.</p><p> Re-creating the tree's life, the author shows how it lived through hundreds of forest fires (a substance in its bark prevents it from burning); housed birds, animals, and insects by the millions; and was visited by generations of American Indians, including the Miwoks and Wukchumnis. </p><p> At the same time the tree offers a unique chronology, a living time line. While the tree was growing . . . the Greeks tricked the Trojans with a giant horse. While the tree was growing . . . Siddhartha Guatama is born, becomes Buddha, the "awakened one," and founds a new religion. While the tree was growing . . . Cleopatra rules Egypt, Leonardo da Vinci paints the Mona Lisa, Shakespeare writes Hamlet, Thomas Edison invents the photograph, and astronauts walk on the moon. </p><p> And while that same tree was growing . . . you were born. </p><p></p>WHILE THE YOUNG TREE WEATHERS ANOTHER WINTER, KING TUT BECOMES RULER OF EGYPT<p> A unique chronicle combining history, biology, Native American folklore, and more, WHILE A TREE WAS GROWING tells the story of one giant sequoia and the key events that have occurred during its lifetime. Here it is as a sapling, struggling to hold its place in the forest, while the Chinese are beginning to develop writing; fifteen centuries later, when Jesus is born, it is a full-grown sequoia, over 200 feet tall; and when the first settlers cross the Sierra Nevada, this fire-scarred survivor has lived for over three thousand years. Full-page, full color paintings throughout evoke the life of the tree and its animal neighbors, while illustrations and photographs accompany the time-line narration. A pull-out poster is included with the book. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Singers and the Song</h2><p>Led by Frank Sinatra, the generation that emerged during and after World War II raised the performance of the popular song to the level of art form. This book examines some of the most gifted of these singers--people like Sinatra, Dick Haymes, Peggy Lee, Jo Stafford, Sarah Vaughan, and Andy Russell.<br> _____Far from being the simple intuitive performers the public thought it knew, these people emerge as intelligent, skillful, and fully conscious artists dedicated to their work. Lees's insights and anaylsis reveal Sinatra in particular as we've never seen him before. Calling him "our poet laureate, the best singer we've ever heard," Lees points out Sinatra's technical virtuosity--his extraordinary breath control and ability to link one phrase to another, his exquisite enunciation (especially the way he can brilliantly sustain consonants like <em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>l</em>, and <em>r</em>), his uncanny ability to sing into a microphone so that it seemed as natural as speech. As Julius LaRosa said, "He was able to turn a 32-bar song into a 3-act play."<br> _____But the book is not just about singers. It is also about composers, including the great film composer Hugo Friedhodfer, and the supremely talented lyricist Johnny Mercer. It is about language: a fascinating chapter compares English with French, revealing the implications for lyricists (for example, only four words rhyme with "love" in English while 51 rhyme with "amour" in French!). It is about the social history of twentieth century America, seen through the mirror of popular music. And it's about war--a theme that runs through the book, from the Viking conquest of northwestern France through World War II to the present. Humanity's creative impulse--the yearning to raise our voices in song--is contrasted to mankind's increasing destructivenss.<br> _____ The book's themes are linked at the end in the story of the making of one extraordinary album created by an international group of figures, with Lees himself as lyricist translating and adapting poems of Pope John Paul II, and Sarah Vaughan as the featured singer.<br></p><p>Far from being the simple intuitive performers the public thought it knew, these people emerge as intelligent, skillful, and fully conscious artist dedicated to their work.

And despite the political intrigue that Roxanne finds herself involved in, she cannot deny her passion for the handsome young man. But can Robbie protect Roxanne and her children from the machinations of the unscrupulous Englishmen and turncoat Scotsmen threatening their love and future together?

Jewel Lansing has amassed a treasure trove of information on Portland&#39;s civic and political life, which she presents in a readable style, organized around an account of the successive reigns of Portland&#39;s 44 mayors. The story is enlivened by anecdotes that bring to life the unique individuals and controversial issues of Portland&#39;s distant and more recent past. Lansing shows that Portland&#39;s path to its present place as the 28th largest city in the United States, with a deserved reputation as one of the nation&#39;s most livable cities, has not always been smooth, and its story is far from dull. Corruption, profiteering, and wide-open vice characterized Portland at the turn of the century, and every era has had its controversies and rivalries: disputes over railroad franchises and rights-of-way, women&#39;s suffrage, public versus private power, the Chinese Exclusion Act, Prohibition, and the siting of freeways, to name just a few. Colorful personalities, from Populist governor-turned-mayor Sylvester Pennoyer to tavern-owner-turned-mayor Bud Clark, have emerged in every period, as the city has grown and its government has evolved from a small group of volunteers to a complex bureaucracy with 8,000 employees and a $1.1 billion budget. Anyone with an interest in Portland, and in learning more about the individuals, events, and issues that have shaped it, will find this exhaustive history fascinating and extremely informative.</p><p>Jewel Lansing served as the elected City of Portland Auditor from 1983 to 1986 and as Multnomah County Auditor from 1975 to 1982.

The right to the fur trade in America had been granted--given away, as the English of the time thought--by the hand of Charles II of England. In prodigal fashion Charles conceded, in 1670, a charter, which conveyed extensive lands, with the privileges of monopoly, to the &#39;Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson&#39;s Bay.&#39; But if the courtiers of the Merry Monarch had any notion that he could thus exclude all others from the field, their dream was an empty one. The Red River Colony (or Selkirk Settlement) was a colonization project set up in 1811 by Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk on 300,000 square kilometres (120,000 sq mi) of land. This land was granted to him by the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company, which is referred to as the Selkirk Concession. The establishment of Canada in the late 19th century led to the creation of what is today Manitoba, although much of its original territory is now part of the United States. The Selkirk Concession, also known as Selkirk&#39;s Grant, included the portions of Rupert&#39;s Land, or the watershed of Hudson Bay, bounded on the north by the line of 52� N latitude roughly from the Assiniboine River east to Lake Winnipegosis. It then formed a line of 52 degrees N latitude from Lake Winnipegosis to Lake Winnipeg, and by the Winnipeg River, Lake of the Woods and Rainy River. On the west of the Selkirk Concession, it is roughly formed by the current boundary between Saskatchewan and Manitoba. These covered portions consist of present-day southern Manitoba, northern Minnesota, and eastern North Dakota, in addition to small parts of eastern Saskatchewan, northwestern Ontario, and northeastern South Dakota. Growing up in Scotland in the wake of the Jacobite rising of 1745, Lord Selkirk was constantly troubled by the plight of his Scottish kin. Selkirk was influenced by humanitarian luminaries such as William Wilberforce and, following the forced displacement of Scottish farmers that took place during the Highland Clearances, decided that emigration was the only viable option to improve the livelihood of the Scottish people. Upon inheriting his father&#39;s title in 1799, Selkirk focused the majority of his time and resources on establishing a Scottish colony in North America. Selkirk became interested in the Red River region after reading Alexander MacKenzie&#39;s Voyages in 1801; however, Selkirk was prevented from settling the region in 1802 when the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company raised concerns that the proposed colony would interfere with the running of the company. During the first decade of the nineteenth century Selkirk established two unsuccessful agricultural colonies in British North America but continued to pursue the settlement of the Red River region.[3] By 1807 Selkirk acknowledged that an alliance with either the Hudson&#39;s Bay or North West Company, the dominant fur trading companies at the time, was essential to the establishment of a colony at Red River. By 1811 the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company had reconsidered Selkirk&#39;s proposal and granted Selkirk 300,000 km2 (116,000 sq mi), an area five times the size of Scotland, to establish an agricultural settlement in the region of Red River. Supplies of &#34;produce, such as flour, beef, pork and butter...&#34; would be affordable to manufacture in this colony, and would reduce the costly shipments from Britain.[4] The grant was also pending the annual provision of 200 men to the company and Selkirk&#39;s assurance that the colony would remain out of the fur trade.[3] Selkirk, who once mocked the fur trade for rarely grossing more than 200, 000 and only having 3 ships employed in its service, gladly agreed to the terms.:[5] Selkirk referred to this new territory as the District of Assiniboia.[6] At the time of the concession, Red River was the only Hudson Bay Colony that had been established within the company&#39;s 610,000-hectare (1.5-million-acre) territory.</p><p></p><h2>Among the Hidden</h2><p>Among the Hidden</p><p></p><h2>Why We Never Danced the Charleston</h2><p>The homosexual love affair between Hirsch Hess, the son of Jewish immigrants, and Ned Grimske, the member of an aristocratic Christian family, sets off scandal and tragedy in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1923</p><p>Harlan Greene is a native of Charleston, and the author of several books of fiction and nonfiction.

Here, as a follow-up to her <i>Spago Desserts</i> cookbook, Bergin's chocolate indulgences range from a decadently satiny Chocolate Cheesecake, and assorted brownies, to her complex Hazelnut Dome, a round of ethereal chocolate and hazelnut cake mounded with rich mousse, all concealed in a chocolate shell. Among the most memorable recipes here are the Heavenly Banana Souffl� Surprise and Peanut Butter Cups. Melted chocolate is the secret surprise at the heart of the classic souffl�. Thanks to the recipe-writing work of Judy Gethers, you will see that this unforgettable composition is really easy to make. The Peanut Butter Cups, balls of butter-silkened peanut butter set into chocolate-filled mini-cups, would make E.T. forget about going home.<p> Understanding time pressures faced by even devoted home cooks, Gethers tells how far ahead each of the nearly 100 extravaganzas in <i>Spago Chocolate</i> can be made.

Here and there -- in rural townships, small towns and the older parts of cities -- many of its original houses are still standing, a surprising number lovingly restored and maintained with historical authenticity in mind. <b>Old Ontario Houses: Traditions in Local Architecture</b>, a collaborative tribute to the past by writer Tom Cruickshank and renowned photographer John de Visser, offers a glimpse into a selection of these homes dating from the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, more than 150 in all. Filled with de Visser's exceptional full color photographs, the book features well-known landmarks as well as vintage houses. Their stories, told in Cruickshank's lively, appreciative voice, remind us of a bygone era and speak volumes about the values and aspirations of the province that built them. </p></p><p><p> <b>Tom Cruickshank</b> is a history and architecture enthusiast. The former editor of <i>Century Home</i> magazine and the current editor of <i>Harrowsmith Country Life</i> magazine, he is also the author of <i>Rogues' Hollow</i>, <i>The Settler's Dream</i> and <i>Port Hope: A Treasure of Early Homes</i>. </p><p> <b>John de Visser</b> enjoys a reputation as one of the most-respected and most-published photographers in Canada. </p><p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>Next time you're browsing through the real estate section of <i>The Toronto Star</i>, count the number of times you come across the term "all brick" in the advertisements for new subdivision houses. Like "ravine lot" and "parklike setting," "all brick" has a certain cachet for home buyers, and as buzzwords go, it probably carries more weight in Ontario than in, say, Calgary or Montreal, where brick construction was never so firmly entrenched in local building traditions. Indeed, Ontario is synonymous with brick and always has been. If you need more proof, just take the bridge across the international boundary from Sault Ste. Marie to the Soo in Michigan, from Fort Erie to Buffalo or from Prescott to Ogdensburg, New York. One of the first things an astute visitor will notice is the extent to which the American towns are dominated by frame houses and wood siding. Back home in Ontario, however, it's a different story, whether the dwellings are old or new.</p> <p>From day to day, we tend not to notice our predilection for brick houses, but we ought to acknowledge it for what it is: one of the most recognizable traits of Ontario's architectural legacy and something that distinguishes us from our neighbours. But it is not the only virtue specific to our vintage houses. Ontario even has its own homegrown signature style, once so common in our towns and countryside as to be ubiquitous but just as valid a hallmark as the saltbox in New England and the steep-roofed habitant homestead in Quebec. Our style has no official name but can easily be recognized by the symmetrical arrangement of doors and windows under a roof that stands only a storey and a half high. Over the front entrance is another identifying mark: a gable peak fitted with a Gothic-pointed window. Similar houses can be spotted from Massachusetts to Manitoba but never in the same numbers as in the corridor between Windsor and Cornwall and north into the Canadian Shield. Although the type has been around since the early days of settlement, only in recent years have we seemed to notice that this is something we can truly call our own. Perhaps the time has come to give it a proper name: the "Ontario farmhouse" style.</p> <p>Although easier to heat and more economical to build than a house a full two storeys high, the Ontario farmhouse owes its popularity more to politics than to pragmatism. Beginning in 1807, it was taxed at a significantly lower rate. At the same time, despite the ornament often lavished upon it, the gable was a purely practical amenity: It made the attic space more usable, providing extra headroom and much-needed light. Thus a provincial icon was born that would survive long after the tax was revoked in 1853. In fact, it was well after Confederation, when building fashion and technology embraced a new bigger-is-better ethic, that the classic Ontario farmhouse finally lost ground. Today, thousands of the genre survive in the heartland, a sampling of which are pictured on the pages that follow. As you study them, look for variations on the theme, especially the manner in which the front gable grew progressively steeper as the 19th century wore on.</p> <p>The storey-and-a-half farmhouse may be our signature tune, but old Ontario is rich in other architectural melodies, each a reflection of the times. Very few, however, are pure examples of their type, unsullied by outside influences. Rare was the builder who, embarking upon an Italianate-style house, for example, could resist tossing in a few Gothic touches here and there. Indeed, most Ontario houses are unabashedly eclectic. They owe their symmetry to the Georgian tradition, while their verandahs were inherited from the Regency style. Roof brackets and slender windows are Italianate, and Gothicism shows in pointed church-style windows. Another feature that marks Ontario architecture is its tendency toward conservatism. Even in the 20th century, the concept of "home" was more often expressed in the tried-and-true than in the avant-garde. Likewise, it was considered quite vulgar to display one's wealth with anything pretentious or overtly extravagant. But when you think about it, perhaps this isn't surprising. After all, the very first settlers in the province, the United Empire Loyalists, were by nature a conservative breed, aghast at the revolutionary ideals of the new United States. It could be argued that Loyalist values set the tone for generations to come.</p> <p>It is also no surprise to learn that Ontario houses, like the people themselves, were a blend of American and British influences, although builders were more likely to look to mother England for inspiration than south of the border. This would account for our preference for the British-born Regency and Gothic stylings, neither of which is as well represented in bordering states. And it also speaks volumes about why the Greek Revival, which swept the United States in the 1820s and 1830s, seldom took full flight in Ontario. It seems that its connections to democratic ideals and republican principles were just too much for monarchist Upper Canada. Indeed, suspicious eyebrows were often raised at any builder whose house displayed undue Yankee influence.</p> <p>It is sad to note that many of our older houses were lost in the battle with 20th-century progress. Some were lost to neglect, but many more -- in city and country alike -- were bulldozed to pave the way for development, especially in the Toronto-centred conurbation between Oshawa and Niagara Falls. Fortunately, public opinion is no longer indifferent to the fate of our architectural heritage, and there is a whole new generation of enthusiasts for whom restoring an old Ontario dwelling is the stuff of dreams. This book offers plenty of inspiration, as it divides the province along informal geographical lines and presents capsule portraits of some of our very best vintage houses. Presented here are quaint farmhouses and fashionable urban addresses from almost every corner of the province, textbook examples of architectural finesse as well as homespun vernacular style, rare houses of the late 18th century, plenty from the 19th and several that demonstrate the new directions of the early 20th. Some are museums, but most are privately owned and maintained. Some are ordinary, some are exceptional, but all are possessed of a certain timeless charm. And more than a few are brick.</p> <p><i>A Note on Nomenclature</i></p> <p>If you followed the news in the 1990s, you know that the municipalities of Ontario have been reorganized. The process actually started in the early 1970s, when regional government was introduced to replace the county system. The latest round of reorganization has been much more thorough: New megacities have been created, and many a town and township have been amalgamated, not always willingly. Along with the changes, some familiar places have literally been wiped off the map, but the old names linger in common parlance, and for the purposes of this book, they remain very much alive. In a work that highlights history, it seems only natural to refer to Norfolk County, the City of Trenton and Darlington Township, even though none of them officially exist as municipal entities anymore. Somehow, the new names -- the Region of Haldimand-Norfolk, the City of Quinte West and the Municipality of Clarington -- don't yet trip as lightly off the tongue.</p></p><h2>An Amish Table: A Recipe for Hope, Building Faith, Love in Store</h2><p><p><strong><em>A Recipe for Hope</em> by Beth Wiseman</strong></p><p>(Previously published in <em>An Amish Kitchen</em>)</p><p>When a storm blows a tree onto Eve Bender&#x2019;s farmhouse, she has little choice but to temporarily move her family into her parents&#x2019; home.

Arthur seeks peace, with the aid of his sword Excaliber . . . After rebellions and betrayals by those he believed loved him most, Arthur looks at his most weak. His Saxon enemies decide to strike before he regains his strength, plunging Britain into war. It will require all Arthur&#39;s leadership and military cunning to win this last battle. But in this final struggle of the warlord, the intrigues of Mordred, now the adult heir to the throne of Britain, and the dark magic of the priestess Nimue could conspire to bring about Arthur&#39;s downfall. Even his trusty blade Excaliber may not be sharp enough to save him . . . Bernard Cornwell concludes The Warlord Chronicles, bringing the Arthurian legend to thrilling new life. &#39;A powerful and dramatic retelling of the Arthurian legend&#39; Sharon Penman &#39;Of all the books I have written these are my favourites&#39; Bernard Cornwell</p><p>The third novel in the Warlords Chronicle, <i>Excalibur: A Novel of Arthur</i> immerses the reader in the Britain of the Dark Ages. Merlin, the greatest of the Druids, believes that the ancient gods are deserting Britain, and that the invading Saxons can't be defeated without the gods' help. Mordred reigns with a brutal hand, and Arthur sees his dreams of peace evaporate. The author provides exciting descriptions of swordplay and battles, interspersed with somewhat gruesome depictions of ordinary life in those days--greasy, waist-length beards serving as napkins, lambs bloodily sacrificed before festivals, and rampant lice.<p> But at the heart of <i>Excalibur</i>--what makes the Arthurian legends eternally fascinating--is the larger-than-life company of heroes, from Sagramor the warrior to Taliesin the bard, Guinevere, Lancelot, and Arturus Rex himself. Cornwell treats them all with warmth and dignity, revealing their human qualities without unnecessarily reinventing them.

In 1891, her grandson Paul Gauguin set sail for Tahiti, determined to escape civilization and paint primitive masterpieces. Flora died before her grandson was born, but their travels and obsessions unfold side by side in this deft, utterly absorbing novel.<br><br>Flora, the illegitimate child of a wealthy Peruvian father and French mother, grows up in poverty, and after fleeing a brutal husband, journeys to Peru to demand her inheritance. On her return, she makes her name as a popular writer and a champion of the downtrodden, setting herself the arduous task of touring the French countryside to recruit members for her Workers' Union. Paul, struggling painter and stubborn visionary, abandons his wife and five children for life in the South Seas, where his dreams of paradise are poisoned by syphilis, the stifling forces of French colonialism, and a chronic lack of funds, though he has his pick of teenage Tahitian lovers and paints some of his greatest works.<br><br>Affectionate, astute, and quietly caustic, this double portrait is a rare study in passion and ambition, as well as the obstinate pursuit of greatness in the face of illness and death, from Mario Vargas Llosa, whose previous novels, <i>The Feast of the Goat</i>, "pushed the boundaries of the traditional historic novel [in] a book of harrowing power and lasting resonance" (<i>The New York Times</i>).<br><br></p><p><br><b>Mario Vargas Llosa</b>'s novels include <i>Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter</i>, <i>In Praise of the Stepmother</i>, <i>The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto, </i>and <i>The Feast of the Goat</i>. He lives in London.<br><br>Postimpressionist painter Paul Gauguin's dramatic life inspired Somerset Maugham's classic The Moon and Sixpence; now Vargas Llosa takes his turn re-imagining the artist's story in an intricately detailed novel that also chronicles the life of Gauguin's feminist-socialist grandmother, Flora Trist&nbsp;n. Splitting the narrative between Trist&nbsp;n's tour of France in 1844, which she made to recruit support for her Workers Union, and Gauguin's life after landing in Tahiti in 1891, Vargas Llosa shows how each sought something-be it social reform or artistic truth-greater than themselves. The illegitimate child of a Peruvian man and a French woman, Trist&nbsp;n flees her villainous husband and makes her way to Peru, where she hopes to claim her inheritance from her late father's Peruvian relatives. When she fails, she returns to Europe and throws herself into radical politics. Gauguin's story is better known-the abdication of bourgeois existence for art; the brief, conflicted cohabitation with Van Gogh; the voyage to Tahiti; the sexual escapades there, and the ravages of syphilis; the final voyage to the Marquesas Islands-and Vargas Llosa tells it carefully. His twin tales achieve force and momentum through the sheer accumulation of detail and the relentlessly chronicled physical decline of both protagonists. But though usually a master of rhetoric and tone, Vargas Llosa loses his footing here, syncopating his account with second-person remarks that condescend to his characters ("Alas, Florita! It was all for the best that it hadn't happened, wasn't it?"; "[Y]ou weren't dreaming of anything so foolish, were you, Paul?"). Flora Trist&nbsp;n deserves to be better known, and this novel should accomplish that goal. But despite Wimmer's excellent translation, Vargas Llosa's latest too often feels like a weighty, unwieldy account of two exciting lives, which does neither its subjects nor its author's past artistry a service. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Yoga of Nutrition (Izvor Collection, Vol 204)</h2><p>Used.

But Genoa was also one of medieval Europe's major centers of trade and commerce. In <i>Genoa and the Genoese, 958-1528</i>, Steven Epstein has written the first comprehensive history of the city that traces its transformation from an obscure port into the capital of a small but thriving republic with an extensive overseas empire. In a series of chronological chapters, Epstein bridges six centuries of medieval and Renaissance history by skillfully interweaving the four threads of political events, economic trends, social conditions, and cultural accomplishments. He provides considerable new evidence on social themes and also examines other subjects important to Genoa's development, such as religion, the Crusades, the city's long and combative relations with the Muslim world, the environment, and epidemic disease, giving this book a scope that encompasses the entire Mediterranean. Along with the nobles and merchants who governed the city, Epstein profiles the ordinary men and women of Genoa. <i>Genoa and the Genoese, 958-1528</i> displays the full richness and eclectic nature of the Genoese people during their most vibrant centuries.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"This book has much to offer specialists in Italian history and students of the medieval city in general."-- <i>Speculum</i> <br>In this comprehensive history of Genoa, Steven Epstein traces the city&#39;s transformation from an obscure port into the capital of a small but thriving republic with an extensive overseas empire.

Zane Westmoreland dropped down in the chair across from his sister, a dark frown covering his face.<br><br>He fixed his gaze on Bailey, waiting on her response. Bailey knew that any mention of Channing Hastings would make him mad, but it seemed she was intent on ignoring him while she continued to eat her bowl of ice cream. Anyone else would have jumped at the anger that was apparent in his voice but not this particular sister. She didn't do anything until she was good and ready. While he waited, even more irritation bubbled up inside of him.<br><br>After what seemed like an enormous period of silence, Bailey finally angled her head. "I meant just what I said. I saw Channing today when I had lunch at the hospital with Megan. I understand she arrived in town last week. She looks good by the way."<br><br>Zane wasn't surprised. As far as he was concerned, there was never a time when Channing hadn't looked good...even after a sweaty workout session at the gym.<br><br>Suddenly, unbridled fury worked its way along his stomach lining. Why should he care how an ex-girlfriend looked? More importantly, why did the thought of her being back in town trigger such deep-seated anger within him?<br><br>Zane could answer that question without much thought. It hadn't been their breakup that still pissed him off but rather <i>how</i> they had broken up. Usually he was the one who decided when one of his relationships ended, but Channing had surprised the hell out of him and ended it herself.<br><br>"Is Channing's fiance with her?" He could have bitten off his tongue for asking.<br><br>"No, she's only here for six weeks, hosting a medical symposium at the hospital." Bailey didn't say anything for a minute and then, "That man got under my skin."<br><br>Zane lifted a brow. "What man?"<br><br>"Channing's fiance. He was checking out the women at Megan's wedding reception, even with Channing standing right beside him. He had a lot of nerve."<br><br>Zane had noticed the man's roving eyes, as well. He really shouldn't care. If Channing was inclined to put up with that kind of foolishness, that was her business. It shouldn't concern him. But it did.<br><br>He glanced out the window while his mind wandered back in time. He had dated Channing longer than he'd dated any other woman&#x2014;nine months exactly. Things had been almost perfect between them. But then she'd started hinting that she wanted more from their relationship. That was when he'd reiterated that he was not the marrying kind and never intended to be.<br><br>She never brought up the issue again, and Zane had assumed things were back to normal. But less than a month later, out of the clear blue sky, she told him that she had accepted a job at a hospital in Atlanta and would be moving away.<br><br>That had annoyed the hell out of him. She was trying to force his hand, and he wouldn't allow any woman to do that. So he'd called her bluff, refusing to offer a proposal. But then she'd moved to Atlanta as planned. That was almost two years ago, and he hadn't seen or heard from her until she'd shown up at his sister's wedding last month an engaged woman.<br><br><i>Engaged.</i><br><br>The very thought made him angry. She'd had the nerve to bring her fiance to the wedding knowing full well Zane would be there. And like Bailey had said, the man had checked out other women even with Channing by his side. That she was so desperate to have a ring on her finger that she would settle for such a man&#x2014;the realization made Zane madder.<br><br>"This is simply delicious."<br><br>Bailey's words intruded on his thoughts. He glanced over at his sister, and his frown deepened. He had come home to find her sitting at his kitchen table like she lived there. In his current mood, her presence aggravated him. "And what do you think you're doing?"<br><br>She smiled. "What does it look like? I'm eating ice cream."<br><br><i>"My</i> ice cream," he muttered. "How did you get in here, anyway? I changed the locks on my door."<br><br>Bailey leaned back in her chair and chuckled. "I noticed. Did you forget that I know how to pick a lock, Zane? Bane taught me ages ago. And as far as the ice cream, you only bought it because you knew I'd eat it.<br><br>You don't even like ice cream, and this is one of my favorite flavors."<br><br>"They're all your favorite flavors," he said, forcing himself not to grin. The last thing he needed was for her to think he was getting soft. And as far as picking locks, he had forgotten that talent had been just one of the many ways she and their cousin Bane used to get into trouble.<br><br>Getting up from the table, he headed for the door.<br><br>"Hey, where are you going?" Bailey called after him.<br><br>"Since I can't find peace in my own home, I'm going to ride my horse a spell. I'll be gone for an hour or so and hopefully that will give you time to find someone else to visit."<br><br>He then walked out the door and slammed it shut behind him.<br><br>"Channing, wait up!"<br><br>Channing stopped and turned around. She smiled when she saw Megan Claiborne walking briskly toward her. Megan had been one of the first doctors she'd become good friends with while working at the hospital four years ago, and their friendship had remained intact. Last month, Megan married Rico Claiborne, a gorgeous Bradley Cooper lookalike who worked as a private investigator in Philly. To divide their time between Philadelphia and Denver, Megan worked six months as a doctor of anesthesiology in Denver and the other six months at a hospital in Philly.<br><br>Megan looked different. "Marriage agrees with you," Channing said when Megan came to a stop in front of her.<br><br>Her comment made an infectious smile settle on Megan's lips. "You think so?"<br><br>"I know so. There's a radiant glow about you. You seem happy. I mean truly happy," Channing said.<br><br>Megan's smile widened. "I <i>am</i> happy, and I have to concur that marriage does agree with me. Rico is the best. He's everything I could ever want in a man."<br><br>"Then you have a reason to smile and look radiant." Channing was happy for her friend and she wanted that same happiness and radiance for herself.<br><br>Long marriages were common in Channing's family. Her parents had been married for more than thirty-five years, and her grandparents would be celebrating their sixtieth wedding anniversary next year. Her aunts and uncles had been in wedded bliss for more than twenty years, and her cousins and oldest brother, Juan, had all been married eight years or more.<br><br>When Channing had dated Megan's brother Zane a few years back, she had believed he was the one. Although he had told her more than once that he never intended to marry, she'd actually thought he'd change his mind. Over the course of their relationship, although he'd never spoken any words of love, his actions had convinced her he had feelings for her. He'd been so attentive, possessive and protective. She was the first woman he'd invited to his family's weekly dinner gatherings and the first woman he'd given a key to his place. So, quite naturally, she had assumed she meant more to him than all the women he'd dated in the past.<br><br>But as time went by, it became obvious that he had no intention of making their relationship more than the affair that it was. Then, one day after they'd dated exclusively for almost nine months&#x2014;she'd come out and asked him how he saw their relationship evolving. He'd told her nothing had changed. He never intended to marry. He'd said that although he cared for her, he didn't love her&#x2014;and never would.<br><br>She'd appreciated his honesty, but his words had hurt. To protect her heart from further damage, she'd decided to move on. She wanted more.<br><br>A week later, she'd accepted the position as a neurologist at Emory Hospital in Atlanta. She didn't tell Zane about her plans until the week before she was ready to leave Denver. She knew Zane was still angry with her about the way she'd ended things, but it wasn't as if she'd left town without telling him.<br><br>"I wanted to ask you to come to my family's Friday night chow-down," Megan said, intruding into Chan-ning's thoughts.<br><br>Channing winced. "You know I can't do that."<br><br>"Why not? Things between you and Zane didn't work out, and you moved on. As far as I'm concerned, it was my brother's loss."<br><br>"But I don't want to make things uncomfortable, Megan. I saw the way Zane was staring me down at your wedding. He didn't like the way I ended things between us."<br><br>"Forget Zane." Megan bristled. "Did he honestly expect things to continue between the two of you without him ever making a serious commitment?"<br><br>Channing shrugged, even though she knew Zane <i>had</i> expected that. They had been dating exclusively, and to him that was enough. "I guess he did," Channing said softly, remembering how hard it had been to leave him, to move forward and not look back.<br><br>"Well, it served him right to find out he was wrong." Megan took a moment and seemed to choose her next words carefully. "Channing, you were my friend long before you became involved with Zane. You moved away, and now you're back for a short time. There's nothing wrong with me inviting you to dine with my family."<br><br>Channing could see plenty wrong with it. "Thanks, but I think it's best if I don't accept your invitation. I'll be in Denver for at least three weeks, six weeks if I decide to do a second symposium. Considering how Zane feels about me, he and I should keep our distance."<br><br>Megan didn't push...at least not right now. Channing knew her friend wouldn't let it drop. "You're welcome to come. If you change your mind, let me know."<br><br>Channing nodded, but she wouldn't be changing her mind.<br><br>By the time Zane had returned home, Bailey was gone. He headed up the stairs to shower, refusing to admit he missed his sister already. She was known for her drop-in visits not only to him but also to her other brothers, sisters and cousins.<br><br>Presently, there were fifteen Denver Westmorelands. His parents had had eight children: five boys&#x2014;Ramsey, Zane, Derringer and the twins, Aiden and Adrian&#x2014;and three girls&#x2014;Megan, Gemma and Bailey. Uncle Adam and Aunt Clarisse had had seven sons: Dillon, Micah, Jason, Riley, Canyon, Stern and Brisbane. Over the past few years, nearly everyone had gotten married. Megan had married last month, and Riley would marry in September. The only holdouts were him, the twins, Bailey, Canyon, Stern and Bane.<br><br>His parents and uncle and aunt had died in a plane crash nearly twenty years ago, leaving Zane's brother Ramsey and his cousin Dillon in charge of the family. It hadn't been easy, especially since several of their siblings and cousins had been under the age of sixteen. Together, Dillon and Ramsey had worked hard and made sacrifices to keep the Westmorelands together. When the state of Colorado tried forcing Dillon to put the youngest four in foster homes, he had refused.<br><br>The deaths had been the hardest on those youngest four&#x2014;the twins, Aiden and Adrian, and Brisbane and Bailey. Everyone had known that their acts of rebellion were their way of handling the grief of losing their parents. Now, the twins had finished college and were working in their chosen professions: Aiden as a doctor and Adrian as an engineer. Brisbane was in the navy and Bailey...was still Bailey. Considered the baby of the family, at twenty-six she worked for <i>Simply Irresistible,</i> a magazine for today's up-and-coming woman that was owned by Ramsey's wife, Chloe. But even with a full-time job, Bailey still managed to remind everyone she could be a force to reckon with when she put her mind to it.<br><br>When Zane reached his bedroom, he glanced out the window at the acres and acres of land surrounding him. Westmoreland Country. Since Dillon was the oldest, he had inherited the main house along with the three hundred acres it sat on. Everyone else, upon reaching the age of twenty-five, received one hundred acres to call their own. Thanks to Bailey's creative mind, each of their spreads were given names&#x2014;Ramsey's Web, Zane's Hideout, Derringer's Dungeon, Megan's Meadows, Gemma's Gem, Jason's Place, Stern's Stronghold and Canyon's Bluff. It was beautiful land that encompassed mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers and streams.<br><br>Zane loved his home, a two-story structure with a wraparound porch. He had more than enough space for himself and a family&#x2014;if he ever chose to marry. But since settling down with one woman was not in his plans, he had the place all to himself. Some people did better by themselves, and he was one of those people.<br><br>Except when it came to business. He, his brother Derringer and his cousin Jason were partners in a lucrative horse breeding and training business along with several of his Westmoreland cousins who lived in Montana and Texas. The partnership was doing extremely well financially, with horse buyers extending all the way to the Middle East. Ever since one of their horses, Prince Charming, had placed in the Kentucky Derby a few years ago, potential clients had been continually coming out of the woodwork.<br><br>He was happy with his work. Zane liked the outdoors. The only thing he liked better was women. He didn't have a problem with the revolving door to his bedroom, and he didn't intend for any woman to get it in her head that she could be the one. There wasn't a woman alive who could make him think about settling down.<br><br>A quick flash of pain across his gut let him know he wasn't being truthful about that. There <i>had</i> been one woman. Dr. Channing Hastings.<br><br>Zane's sister Megan had introduced them, and he had been attracted to Channing from the first time he'd seen her. In addition to her beauty, she had a luscious scent that drew him like a bee to honey. She was the very thing erotic fantasies were made of. He'd only intended to date her for a couple of months. Then, the next thing he knew, he was in an exclusive relationship.<br><br>Zane reached under his bed for the locked box he'd placed there. Using the key he kept on his key ring, he opened the box and pulled out the calendar that was inside. It was a personalized photo calendar that Channing had made for him as a gift on his thirty-fifth birthday. Had it been almost two years ago?<br><br>He flipped through the calendar, beginning with January. By the time he'd gotten to December, he had worked up a sweat. Seeing Channing dressed in such scanty attire&#x2014;a different outfit for every month&#x2014;had sent memories soaring through his mind. In January, she wore a floor-length red gown, the same one she'd worn to a charity benefit he'd taken her to at the hospital and the same one he'd loved taking off of her later that night. By December, she was wearing nothing at all while stretched across her bed in one damn hot position, her body barely covered by a white bedspread decked with colorful Christmas ornaments. She had one of those <i>I want you now</i> looks on her face. The photographer had been another female doctor whose hobby was photography, and she had captured Channing in some unbelievable poses. Channing Hastings was definitely a beautiful woman.</p><h2>The Shock Of The Old: Technology and Global History since 1900</h2><p>Shock of the Old<br>(iPhone)<br></p><p>Born in Montevideo in 1959, David Edgerton is one of Britain&#39;s leading historians, and has challenged conventional analyses of technology for 20 years.

In this, his final novel, he confronts the legacy of evil, and our unquenchable desire to wrest good from it.<br>&nbsp;<br>One week in late autumn of 1996, a group gathers at the site of a former death camp. They offer prayer at the crematoria and meditate in all weathers on the selection platform. They eat and sleep in the sparse quarters of the Nazi officers who, half a century before, sent more than a million Jews in this camp to their deaths. Clements Olin has joined them, in order to complete his research on the strange suicide of a survivor. As the days pass, tensions both political and personal surface among the participants, stripping away any easy pretense to resolution or healing. Caught in the grip of emotions and impulses of bewildering intensity, Olin is forced to abandon his observer&#x2019;s role and to bear witness, not only to his family&#x2019;s ambiguous history but to his own.<br>&nbsp;<br>Profoundly thought-provoking, <i>In Paradise</i> is a fitting coda to the luminous career of a writer who was &#x201c;for all readers. He was for the world&#x201d; (<i>National Geographic</i>).</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2014:</strong> Peter Matthiessen, three-time National Book Award winner and esteemed author of both fiction and nonfiction, has never backed away from writing about difficult subjects. In his new novel <i>In Paradise</i>, he sets his story in the mid-'90s at a spiritual retreat at Auschwitz. The novel centers around Clements Olin, an American academic of Polish decent who has traveled to the concentration camp for reasons both spiritual and personal. While Olin makes his own journey, dealing with the bouts of sadness, horror, and absurdity--and even occasional joy--that accompany such a retreat, we are introduced to a group of characters all experiencing their own version of observance and remembrance. The result is a novel that is as profound as anything that Matthiessen has written before. <i>--Chris Schluep</i></p> <p><strong>Praise for Peter Matthiessen:</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;You could well school yourself as a young American writer, in the early 21st century, by reading and then rereading the works of Peter Matthiessen. But of course he wasn't just a writer's writer; he was for all readers. He was for the world.&#x201d; --<i>National Geographic</i></p> <p><strong>Praise for IN PARADISE:</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;Matthiessen&#x2019;s descriptions are poetic and scarifying...he creates indelible vignettes about what remains and what took place here. Like the rest of Matthiessen&#x2019;s vast body of work, &#x201c;In Paradise&#x201d; leads us into questions that define our most profound mysteries.&#x201d;--<i>The Washington Post</i></p> <p>&#x201c;The beauty of [In Paradise] comes in [Matthiessen&#x2019;s] powerful descriptions. With his command of the language, he can add something new and profound to that vast library of Holocaust literature. In Paradise allows Peter Matthiessen to once again demonstrate that he remains one of our most powerful writers.&#x201d;--<i>The Miami Herald</i></p> <p>&#x201c;The conflict between the drama of the self and its surrender in the shadow of the Holocaust is Matthiessen's bold subject...powerful.&#x201d; &#x2013;New York Review of Books &#x201c;Peter Matthiessen's In Paradise is a deeply intelligent study of Holocaust remembrance... bleakly funny... [and] eloquent&#x201d; --<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p> <p>&#x201c;A fitting coda to [Matthiessen&#x2019;s] career... Where better to look for some sort of human essence than in a landscape that embodies us at our worst?...This is the key message of Matthiessen&#x2019;s life and writing -- that we are intricate, thorny, inconsistent, that the lines between good and bad blur within us, that we are capable of anything. The only choice is to remain conscious, to engage with openness.&#x201d; --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Written with a young man&#x2019;s energy, In Paradise possesses an old man&#x2019;s wisdom, which eschews the presumptions of age and the easy attainment of certitude." &#x2013;The Daily Beast &#x201c;In Paradise is a fitting final addition to Matthiessen's oeuvre, in that it combines moral seriousness and imagination grounded in the world with elegance of expression and a willingness to take risk.&#x201d; --<i>National Geographic</i></p> <p>&#x201c;[In Paradise] ... provides rare insight into the dark magnetism of a brutal landmark. What drives a survivor to return? What inspires conflicted visitors to join hands in spontaneous dancing? Matthiessen&#x2019;s courage and clarity in addressing this topic [were] signal virtues of his career.&#x201d; --<i>Newsday</i></p> <p>&#x201c;In Paradise is...contemplative and moving, and in its haunting story of Holocaust survivors who revisit Auschwitz, we find one of the last century&#x2019;s greatest authors penning a book worthy of his legacy.&#x201d; --<i>Grantland</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Matthiessen&#x2019;s writing flexes the same kind of muscularity as others of his generation&#x2014; Vonnegut, Styron, Doctorow&#x2014;but his devotion to Zen Buddhism results in a spiritual journey that&#x2019;s palatable even to the non-spiritual... [his characters] are fully realized people, and within them are the kernels of horror and joy shared by all of humanity&#x201d; --<i>A.V. Club</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Matthiessen can write with ecstatic beauty... In his new novel, In Paradise, he takes what may be his deepest look yet into the abyss...Profound and fiercely fresh.&#x201d; --<i>Tampa Bay Times</i></p> <p>"An ambitious tale that tries to do nothing less than achieve some understanding of 20th century Europe&#x2019;s defining event, the Holocaust.&#x201d; --<i>Buffalo News</i></p> <p>&#x201c;An eloquently written and thought-provoking novel... In Paradise demonstrates that Peter Matthiessen remained a vital part of America&#x2019;s contemporary literary scene, an unflinching original who continued to write provocative narratives.&#x201d; --<i>Counterpunch</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Short and austere... Clements&#x2019; story and those of the others are anguished inquiries, harrowing reassessments and attempts &#x2014; emotional, artistic and spiritual &#x2014; to grasp the ungraspable.&#x201d; --<i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p> <p>&#x201c;[In Paradise] deftly and ruthlessly pursues the battles that we face, both individually and also in dialogue with others, when we try to engage with horrors that can never be named.&#x201d; --<i>The Jewish Book Council</i></p> <p>&#x201c;An earnest, informed, often insightful and...subtle novel.&#x201d; --<i>Christian Science Monitor</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Contains some of the most frightening and passionate writing of Matthiessen&#x2019;s long career ... With In Paradise, Peter Matthiessen has created philosophical and moral cacophony of lasting worth and, indeed, of a strange power. It belongs on the shelf beside At Play in the Fields of the Lord, Far Tortuga, and Shadow Country. Of how many books can that be said?&#x201d; --<i>Open Letters Monthly</i></p> <p>"Not a mere recounting but a persuasive meditation on Auschwitz&#x2019;s history and mythology...Matthiessen uses scenes of confrontation, recollection, bitterness, and selfexamination to trace aspects of culture that led to the Holocaust and that still reverberate today." --<i>Library Journal (starred review)</i></p> <p>"Matthiessen...ponders Auschwitz decades after the Holocaust, in a novel that&#x2019;s philosophical, mordant and surprisingly romantic...An admirable...study of the meaning of survivorship." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><b>Peter Matthiessen </b>was the only writer to win the National Book Award for fiction and nonfiction. A cofounder of <i>The</i> <i>Paris Review, </i>he was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a recipient of its William Dean Howells Award, among many other honors. He was also a world-renowned naturalist, explorer, activist, and Buddhist teacher.

She has been a professional writer for twenty years and works from her home office in the Kansas City area. Her first book for Houghton Mifflin, Orphan Train Rider, won the 1996 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for nonfiction.Gr 4-8-Warren's story of nine-year-old Lee Nailling in Orphan Train Rider (Houghton, 1996) opened a window onto a disturbing period of American history in which children were both victims and heroes. In this follow-up volume, she relates the personal histories of eight men and women-now senior citizens-who were orphaned or abandoned as children and later traveled across the country in trains to meet strangers who would become their new family members. An introductory chapter describes the appalling numbers of homeless children in 19th-century America's large eastern cities and explains how poverty and disease as well as high rates of alcohol and drug addiction contributed to a problem that continued into the 20th century. The personal histories, based on interviews that Warren conducted with her subjects, are rich and compelling and so full of dramatic twists and turns that they could have been conceived by Charles Dickens. Hunger, fear, and isolation are the most common recollections of the men and women who speak from these pages. Fortunately these stories all have happy endings, testimony to the resilience of children and the kindness of strangers. The author also includes information about early social activists such as Charles Loring Brace, who established New York City's Children's Aid Society in 1853. These remarkable stories have enormous human-interest appeal and will provoke serious discussion about just how much life has really changed for children from the last century until today.<p></p><p><i>William McLoughlin, Brookside School, Worthington, OH</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>REVLTN TANNER&#39;S LANE</h2><p>William Hale White (1831-1913) known by his pseudonym Mark Rutherford was a British writer and civil servant.

Each chapter is chocked full of essentials to prepare a school site leader to effectively support school staff to not only conform to legal mandates but also engage in best educational practices in collaborative planning, teaching and home-school communication. The websites provided throughout the chapters and included in a reproducible appendix offer invaluable resources beyond the essentials provided within the pages of this valuable handbook. Likewise, the glossary helps the reader keep up with the latest terminology and jargon that is used in the special education realm. Thank you, Margaret McLaughlin and Kristin Ruedel, for synthesizing for our very busy educational leaders what otherwise could seem like a maze of special education rules, regulations, and legal requirements. This third edition is an up-to-the-minute gift to administrators!<p>I teach the Foundations of Law, Ethics, and Procedures in Special Education course for our special education credential program, so am most interested in this book and its content.

When she is alone, she dreams up variations on recipes. When she meditates, she imagines herself in the warm, comforting center of a gigantic bundt cake. If there is a crisis, she bakes a cake; if there is a reason to celebrate, she bakes a cake. Ruth sees it as an outward manifestation of an inner need to nurture her family&#x2014;which is a good thing, because all of a sudden that family is rapidly expanding. First, her mother moves in after robbers kick in her front door in broad daylight. Then Ruth&#x2019;s father, a lounge singer, who she&#x2019;s seen only occasionally throughout her life, shatters both wrists and, having nowhere else to go, moves in, too. Her mother and father just happen to hate each other with a deep and poisonous emotion reserved only for life-long enemies. Oh, yes indeed!<br><br>Add to this mix two teenagers, a gainfully employed husband who is suddenly without a job, and a physical therapist with the instincts of a Cheryl Richardson and you&#x2019;ve got a delightful and amusing concoction that comes with its own delicious icing.<br><br>One of Jeanne Ray&#x2019;s specialties is giving us believable, totally likable characters, engaged in the large and small dramas and amusements of life. <b>Eat Cake</b> is whimsical, warm, and satisfying. <b>Eat Cake</b> is Jeanne Ray at her best. Pull up a chair and eat cake!</p><p>Jeanne Ray works as a registered nurse at the First Clinic in Nashville, Tennessee. She is married and has two daughters. Together, she and her husband have ten grandchildren. Jeanne is the bestselling author of <b>Julie and Romeo</b> and <b>Step-Ball-Change</b>.Years ago, I went to a seminar on stress reduction at the Y. Most of what the instructor told us struck me as either obvious (make lists of what you have to do and check off what you&#x2019;ve accomplished) or embarrassing (a series of breathing exercises that made me think of Lamaze class), but there was one thing he said that made the whole class worthwhile, a trick I still use when I find myself getting overwhelmed: He told us we should visualize a place where we felt completely safe and peaceful. He said it didn&#x2019;t make any difference if it was someplace we knew well or someplace we&#x2019;d only dreamed about, but that we should think about it in great detail, notice everything around us, memorize all the sights and the sounds. Then he instructed us to go to this place in our minds. I glanced quickly around the room. Everyone had closed their eyes and gone to their childhood bedroom or a beach in Jamaica or wherever life was simpler. I had no idea where I was supposed to go. I felt embarrassed sitting in my folding chair, as if the people around me would know that I was still in the conference hall while they were all walking down a white sand beach with the sun glinting off their hair. I ran over a quick mental list: the house on Lake Placid we rented one summer; my own back porch; Paris, where I&#x2019;ve never been but would like to someday go. None of them seemed right, they all seemed to be asking too little or too much. But when I finally closed my eyes and tried, what I wanted came to me with complete clarity. The place that I went, the place that I still go, was the warm, hollowed-out center of a Bundt cake. It is usually gingerbread, though sometimes that changes. Sometimes it&#x2019;s gingerbread crowned in a ring of poached pears. The walls that surround me are high and soft, but as they go up they curve back, open up to the light, so I feel protected by the cake but never trapped by it. There are a few loose crumbs around my feet, clinging to my hair, and the smell! The ginger and butter, the lingering subtlety of vanilla . . . I press my cheek against the cake, which is soft as eiderdown and still warm. This isn&#x2019;t a fantasy about food exactly, at least not insofar as I want to eat my way through a cake that&#x2019;s taller than I am. It&#x2019;s about being inside of cake, being part of something that I find to be profoundly comforting. The instructor told us to take another deep breath, and all around me I heard the smooth shush of air going in, waiting, coming out. I thought I might never open my eyes.<br><br>Cakes have gotten a bad rap. People equate virtue with turning down dessert. There is always one person at the table who holds up her hand when I serve the cake. No, really, I couldn&#x2019;t, she says, and then gives her flat stomach a conspiratorial little pat. Everyone who is pressing a fork into that first tender layer looks at the person who declined the plate, and they all think, That person is better than I am. That person has discipline. But that isn&#x2019;t a person with discipline, that is a person who has completely lost touch with joy. A slice of cake never made anybody fat. You don&#x2019;t eat the whole cake. You don&#x2019;t eat a cake every day of your life. You take the cake when it is offered because the cake is delicious. You have a slice of cake and what it reminds you of is someplace that&#x2019;s safe, uncomplicated, without stress. A cake is a party, a birthday, a wedding. A cake is what&#x2019;s served on the happiest days of your life.<br><br>This is a story of how my life was saved by cake, so, of course, if sides are to be taken, I will always take the side of cake.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a laugh to think that I was feeling stressed when I signed up for that workshop. What was I feeling stressed about eight years ago? My son, Wyatt, was twelve then, still a full year away from the gawky roller-coaster ride of his teenage years. He asked for help on his homework and introduced me to his friends when they came over to go sledding. Camille was a little girl who still crawled into my lap some nights after dinner and let me brush her hair. I called her Kitten. Camille is sixteen now and about as much a kitten as a lioness eating a half-living zebra on a scorching African veldt. Eight years ago, my mother still lived by herself in Michigan and only came to visit twice a year and sometimes not even that. My husband, Sam, was the hardest-working hospital administrator anyone could have imagined, if one was given to imagining such things. I remember it now and hang my head in disbelief. I want to go back to that person I was, take her by the shoulders and shake her. &#x201c;Look again!&#x201d; I want to say to myself. &#x201c;You are standing in the middle of paradise.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>I arrived home in the rain, my arms filled with groceries. I tried to bring them all in at once, which wasn&#x2019;t exactly possible, but the rain was beating down with such a biblical fury that I thought it would be smarter to make one incredibly challenging trip than three manageable trips. The paper bags, a foolish choice, were melting between my fingers. My keys were so far down in the bottom of my purse (looped over the left wrist) that they might as well have been in Liberia for all the chance I had of getting to them. Not that I was even sure the door was locked. It might have been unlocked. I couldn&#x2019;t turn the doorknob unless I did it with my teeth. It was very clear that I had shown some poor judgment. I kicked at the door.<br><br>Through the window I could see my daughter sitting at the kitchen table reading a magazine. At the second kick she raised her eyes heavily, as if she were in fact not reading at all but had been hypnotized by the magazine. There was a hard wall of rain between us and yet I could still make out the supreme disinterest in her gaze. It was a look I knew intimately. I kicked again. She tilted her head, not entirely sure why I was interrupting her: Clearly, there was the door, I was capable of opening a door; I had keys if the door was, in fact, locked; I could see her weighing all this out in her mind. I felt a critical shift in the balance of the groceries and kicked again, just to speed things along. She sighed, a sound so reverberant with weariness that it made its way across the room and past the door and through the rain to reach me. She lifted her slender frame, a willow, a willow leaf, shuffled to the door, and opened it. When that task had been completed she returned wordlessly to the table and resumed her reading. I pulled myself inside and gasped at the air. One bag, the fifth bag, sensing we had reached the threshold of safety, decided it could no longer bear the burden of its responsibility and split apart, sending tangerines and three packages of frozen spinach and a roll of paper towels and (the kicker) a large plastic bottle of cran-apple juice bouncing over the floor. Not the eggs, not the paper carton of milk, I did not lose sight of the ways in which I was fortunate. I sank to my knees and put the other bags down before they could follow suit. I was profoundly wet. I could not imagine that dolphins ever got this wet.<br><br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t get to my keys,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t locked,&#x201d; Camille said, but she didn&#x2019;t look up.<br><br>I got up off the floor and started to pick up what needed to be picked up. There was a great lake forming beneath me.<br><br>&#x201c;Ruth?&#x201d; My mother came into the kitchen holding a stack of papers in one hand. My mother was always holding papers. They seemed to be a natural extension of her hand. I imagined her sleeping with fistfuls of paper clutched to her chest. &#x201c;I need you to look at these for me. I&#x2019;ve been over them a million times and they just don&#x2019;t make any sense. Does it look like Blue Cross paid the doctor or does it look like I have to pay him? I don&#x2019;t want Dr. Nickerson to think I didn&#x2019;t pay him.&#x201d;<br><br>She was wearing a pink warm-up suit that appeared to have been ironed. She was looking at me, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure that she saw me at all. If she had seen me she surely would have commented on the fact that I looked like I had just been dragged from the lake, that I was raising myself up from a fiery ring of tangerines.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go over them, Mother, but I just got in from the grocery store. I need to put these things away first.&#x201d; I pushed back a wet clump of hair that stuck to the side of my face like seaweed.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you get the dried apricots?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Were they on the list?&#x201d;<br><br>She closed her eyes for a minute. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember. I can&#x2019;t remember anything.&#x201d; She turned to her granddaughter. &#x201c;Camille, it&#x2019;s a terrible thing to be old. I hope you never get to be my age. Or maybe by the time you get to be my age they will have invented a cure for forgetting things.&#x201d;<br><br>Camille made some small humming sound that acknowledged that she had heard her own name spoken but she did not stop reading.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put apricots on the list for next time,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;And these papers. Will you look at these? If I owe Dr. Nickerson money I think I should pay him.&#x201d;<br><br>I scooped up the sodden remains of paper sack and threw them in the garbage. I put myself inside the cake and tried to breathe slowly. I made it a simple lemon cake, no glaze. I was an only child and my parents had been divorced since I was two. My mother had done everything on her own. She had taken good care of me, played rounds of Go Fish, cooked nutritious meals, sewed me clothes that never looked homemade, taught me to play the piano in a passable manner. This was payback time. &#x201c;The mail has already gone out today. Just let me get the milk in the refrigerator.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Camille,&#x201d; my mother said. &#x201c;Come over here and help your mother. We&#x2019;ll get this done in a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>Camille closed her eyes and pushed her fingers against the slender bridge of her nose.

Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket.

What happened between them then will never be known, but both would cherish their brief intimacy for the rest of their lives. <br> The ravages of history would soon take them in quite different directions. After Hitler took power in Germany in 1933, Heidegger became rector of the university in Freiburg, delivering a notorious pro-Nazi address that has been the subject of considerable controversy. Arendt, a Jew, fled Germany the same year, heading first to Paris and then to New York. In the decades to come, Heidegger would be recognized as perhaps the most significant philosopher of the twentieth century, while Arendt would establish herself as a voice of conscience in a century of tyranny and war.<br> Illuminating, revealing, and tender throughout, this correspondence offers a glimpse into the inner lives of two major philosophers.<br><br></p><p><b>Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) taught political science and philosophy at The New School for Social Research in New York and the University of Chicago. Widely acclaimed as a brilliant and original thinker, her works include Eichmann in Jerusalem and The Human Condition.</b><br><br><b>Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) was one of the most significant philosophers of the twentieth century. His works include Being and Time, The Question Concerning Technology, and An Introduction to Metaphysics.</b><br>1.<br><br>10.II.25<br><br>Dear Miss Arendt!<br><br>I must come see you this evening and speak to your heart.<br><br> Everything should be simple and clear and pure between us. Only then will we be worthy of having been allowed to meet. You are my pupil and I your teacher, but that is only the occasion for what has happened to us.1<br><br> I will never be able to call you mine, but from now on you will belong in my life, and it shall grow with you.<br><br> We never know what we can become for others through our Being. But surely some reflection can make clear how destructive or inhibiting the effect we have might be.<br><br> The path your young life will take is hidden. We must be reconciled to that. And my loyalty to you shall only help you remain true to yourself.<br><br> You have lost your "disquiet," which means you have found the way to your innermost, purest feminine essence. Someday you will understand and be grateful-not to me-that this visit to my "office hour" was the decisive step back from the path toward the terrible solitude of academic research, which only man can endure-and then only when he has been given the burden, as well as the frenzy, of being productive.<br><br> "Be happy!"-that is now my wish for you.<br><br> Only when you are happy will you become a woman who can give happiness, and around whom all is happiness, security, repose, reverence, and gratitude to life.<br><br> And only in that way will you be properly prepared for what the university can and should give you. That is the way of genuineness and seriousness, but not in the forced academic activity of many of your sex-activity that one day somehow comes apart, leaving them helpless and untrue to themselves.<br><br> For it is at the point when individual intellectual work begins that the initial preservation of one's innermost womanly essence becomes decisive.<br><br> We have been allowed to meet: we must hold that as a gift in our innermost being and avoid deforming it through self-deception about the purity of living. We must not think of ourselves as soul mates, something no one ever experiences.<br><br> I cannot and do not want to separate your loyal eyes and dear figure from your pure trust, the honor and goodness of your girlish essence.<br><br> But that makes the gift of our friendship a commitment we must grow with. And it prompts me to ask your forgiveness for having forgotten myself briefly during our walk.<br><br> But just once I would like to be able to thank you and, with a kiss on your pure brow, take the honor of your being into my work.<br><br>Be happy, good girl!<br><br>Your<br><br>M. H.<br><br>2.<br><br>21.II.25<br><br>Dear Hannah!<br><br>Why is love rich beyond all other possible human experiences and a sweet burden to those seized in its grasp? Because we become what we love and yet remain ourselves. Then we want to thank the beloved, but find nothing that suffices.<br><br> We can only thank with our selves. Love transforms gratitude into loyalty to our selves and unconditional faith in the other. That is how love steadily intensifies its innermost secret.<br><br> Here, being close is a matter of being at the greatest distance from the other-distance that lets nothing blur-but instead puts the "thou" into the mere presence-transparent but incomprehensible-of a revelation. The other's presence suddenly breaks into our life-no soul can come to terms with that. A human fate gives itself over to another human fate, and the duty of pure love is to keep this giving as alive as it was on the first day.<br><br> If you had met me when you were thirteen, if it had been after only a decade-such speculation is futile. No, it has happened now, when your life is silently preparing to become that of a woman, when you will take the intuition, longing, blossoming, and laughter of girlhood into your life and keep it as a source of goodness, of faith, of beauty, of unending womanly giving.<br><br> And what can I do at this moment?<br><br> I can take care that nothing in you shatters; that any burden and pain you have had in the past is purified; that what is foreign to you and what has happened to you yields.<br><br> The opportunities for womanly existence open to you are completely different from what the "student" in you believes, and much more positive than she suspects. May empty criticism fall away from you, and arrogant negativity recede.<br><br> May masculine inquiry learn what respect is from simple devotion; may one-sided activity learn breadth from the original unity of womanly Being.<br><br> Curiosity, gossip, and scholarly vanity cannot be eradicated; only woman can lend nobility to free intellectual life through the way she is.<br><br> When the new semester comes it will be May. Lilac will leap over the old walls and tree blossoms will well up in the secret gardens-and you will enter the old gate in a light summer dress. Summer evenings will come into your room and toll the quiet serenity of our life into your young soul. Soon they will awaken-the flowers your dear hands will pick, and the moss on the forest floor that you will walk on in your blissful dreams.<br><br> And soon, on a solitary climb, I will greet the mountains whose rocky stillness will meet you someday, and in its lines what I have kept of your essence will return. And I will visit the alpine lake, and look down from the steepest steepness of the precipice into its silent depths.<br><br>Your<br><br>M.<br>� Vittorio Klostermann GmbH: Frankfurt am Main 1998<br>English translation copyright � 2004 by Andrew Shields<br><br>All rights reserved.

She lives in Philadelphia.<br><br>Founded in 1981, the <b>National Museum of Women in the Arts</b> acknowledges and celebrates women's diverse artistic achievements over the centuries. The museum was established to challenge traditional histories of art, to uncover the works of women artists who have been overlooked and unacknowledged, and to ensure the place of women in contemporary art. Since 1987, when the museum opened in downtown Washington, D.C., it has presented more than 140 exhibitions of art made by women. The permanent collection contains approximately 2,600 works from the sixteenth century to the present created by almost seven hundred artists.<br><br>The women's museum also offers extensive education programs in the visual arts, literature, music, and film. To foster recognition of women artists in their home states, the museum has established state committees that sponsor events and organize exhibitions in local museums and art galleries.

Tour.</p><p>Dallas Taylor was born in Denver Colorado, in 1948, and spent his child hood playing music from the age of 10 all over Texas. Dallas&#39; Mother died when he was 13 and his father died when he was 15. Dallas was married at the tender age of 16 and came to Hollywood to &#34;make it in the music bussiness&#34;. And make it he did. Dallas played drums behind some of the greatest musicians in history, including Jimi Hendrix, the Doors , B.B.King and the list goes on.This autobiography-cum-cautionary tale candidly explores the "dark side" of the music industry. Taylor, former drummer of Crosby, Stills and Nash, recounts the excitements and the risks of life in the rock 'n' roll fast lane. He explains that it is very difficult for a young musician to separate the trappings of a successful career--fame, money, sexual debauchery and drugs--from music-making. Consequently, Taylor became one of many rockers to suffer repeated bouts of substance abuse and many broken relationships. Taylor's dream of harmony and freedom--symbolized by the 1969 Woodstock festival--soured as his heroine addiction began to cost him jobs, friends and self-respect. After several suicide attempts, he kicked the habit in 1985, with the help of a treatment program, but his body had suffered; in 1991 he needed a liver transplant. While vividly capturing his younger self's wide-eyed enthusiasm for rock 'n' roll, Taylor begins each chapter with a graphic account of a physical and/or mental pain he has suffered while he played. He presents a stark picture of himself as a rock 'n' roll casualty, while maintaining a belief in the most positive, idealistic aspects of the contemporary music scene.

Why (and when) did he turn his legitimate business into a massive fraud? How did he fool so many smart investors for so long? Who among his family and employees knew the truth?<br><br> The best person to answer these questions&#x2014;and tell the full story of Madoff's rise and fall&#x2014;is Erin Arvedlund. In early 2001, she was suspicious of the amazing returns of Madoff's hedge fund, which no one could explain. Her article in <i>Barron's</i>, based on more than one hundred interviews, could have prevented a lot of misery, had the SEC followed up.<br><br> But almost no one was willing to believe anything bad about "Uncle Bernie"&#x2014;so nice, so humble, so generous to charities. As Arvedlund shows, Madoff was no ordinary liar, but a master of the type of lies people really wanted to believe. He kept his clients at a distance and allowed handsomely paid friends to solicit new ones for him; playing hard to get created an irresistible mystique.<br><br> Now, Arvedlund tackles the tough questions that are still unanswered in the wake of Madoff's collapse: <br><br> Did he start off as a legitimate money manager or was he a fraud from the beginning? Were there indications of larceny at the very start of his career?<br> Why did Madoff's biggest supporters within the industry, such as Walter Noel of Fairfield Greenwich and Ezra Merkin of Gabriel Capital, ignore the warning signs that were so apparent? Did they choose to remain ignorant as long as their commissions rolled in?<br> Why did SEC investigations fail to catch Madoff's Ponzi scheme even though several people had voiced concerns about his operation?<br> Who else helped Madoff carry out his scam? His family and close associates have denied any involvement, but was it possible for one man to engineer a heist of such scope?<br><br> With her keen investigative eye, Arvedlund presents a sweeping narrative of Madoff's career&#x2014;from his youth in Queens, New York, to his early days working for his father-in-law, to his time as chairman of the NASDAQ exchange, and finally to infamy as the world's most notorious swindler. She offers a riveting glimpse of Madoff the man&#x2014;an indifferent student with little ambition who transformed himself into a star with a talent for trading, a reputation for innovation, and an unmistakably erratic nature.<br><br> Readers will be fascinated by Arvedlund's portrayal of Madoff, his empire, and all those who never considered that he might be too good to be true.</p><p><b>Erin Arvedlund</b> is an investigative journalist who has written for <i>Barron's</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, TheStreet.com, and <i>Portfolio.com</i>. In 2001, she wrote the first skeptical article about Bernard Madoff for a major publication. This is her first book.<p>On the morning of March 12, 2009, Bernard Lawrence Madoff stood inside courtroom 24-B on the twenty-fourth floor of the Daniel P. Moynihan U.S. Courthouse in downtown Manhattan. Outside, a strong, wintry spring wind blew, but inside the air was stuffy and hot with tension. The seventy-year-old Madoff sat just past the wooden barrier that separated the public seating gallery. He did not look at anyone, just stared straight ahead, as everyone in the room and on the closed-circuit television watched his every move. Always impeccably dressed, Madoff wore a bespoke business suit in his trademark charcoal gray, paired with a lighter gray silk tie. He was flanked by four attorneys, two on either side of him. His longtime lawyer, Ira Sorkin, was seated on his immediate right, and another attorney, Daniel Horwitz, sat to his left. In front of Madoff and his lawyers were another table and chairs, full of federal prosecutors, but Madoff could see only the backs of their heads. </p><p>Just a few months before, Madoff had commanded the respect and admiration of Wall Street, of his wealthy friends and his charities, of his thousands of investors and believers. But on this day, he commanded nothing and no one, except his own voice. On this morning, at ten a.m. exactly, Madoff faced up to 150 years in prison on eleven criminal counts. </p><p>Madoff rested his fingers on the top of the table in front of him and occasionally took a sip of water from a glass. As U.S. District Judge Dennis Chin entered, everyone in the room stood, including Madoff, the phalanx of attorneys, dozens of reporters, and a court sketch artist. There was also a mob of angry Madoff investors, calling themselves "victims" and "casualties," who had come to seek vengeance on the man who had done them wrong. </p><p>"You wish to plead guilty to all eleven counts?" Judge Chin looked up matter-of-factly and spoke somewhat kindly to Madoff. </p><p>Nodding his head of wavy, pewter-colored hair, Madoff listened and answered calmly throughout Judge Chin's many questions and clarifications that followed: "You understand you are giving up the right to a trial? If there were a trial, you could see and hear witnesses, offer evidence on your behalf," and so forth. Judge Chin wanted to make sure this was what Madoff had chosen: to plead guilty, and thus not to cooperate with the government's investigation or to indict anyone else in his crime, the $65 billion Ponzi scheme that was proving to be America's largest financial fraud ever. No, Madoff didn't want a public trial; he didn't want to have to point the finger at anyone else. Given the scope of the charges against him, it was a stubborn move. </p><p>To each question, Madoff answered, "Yes, I do." Madoff was waiving his right to due process in a court of law. He was going to plead guilty and would alone admit to everything he was charged with, including securities fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, making false statements, and perjury. </p><p>And that was exactly how he wanted it. </p><p>Madoff's blue eyes looked weary and his expression resigned. No longer was he sporting that insane-looking smirk, the smile &#x2014; of what? the unburdened? &#x2014; that had incensed everyone who had seen him walking around freely while he was out on bail in the days after his December 11, 2008, confession and arrest. Now, three months later, the smirk had vanished. He began wringing his hands. One of the prosecutors in front of him, Acting U.S. Attorney Lev Dassin, stood up to address the court. "The charges reflect an extraordinary array of crimes committed by Bernard Madoff for over twenty years," Dassin said. "While the alleged crimes are not novel, the size and scope of Mr. Madoff's fraud are unprecedented." Assistant U.S. Attorney Marc Litt, the chief prosecutor in the case, then stood up and told the judge that Madoff could face up to 150 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines. </p><p>Finally, it was Madoff's turn to speak. The room stilled. </p><p>"Mr. Madoff, tell me what you did," Judge Chin said. Madoff had prepared a statement, which he read out loud from stapled paper pages. He took full blame. He wasn't going to cooperate with the prosecutors, wasn't going to help them out and bargain for leniency or a lesser sentence. He wasn't about to indict his family or anyone else for helping in this fraud &#x2014; a fraud so large, encompassing more than four thousand client accounts, that even the Nobel Peace Prize winner and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, whose charity had lost millions, had been driven to calling Madoff "a thief and a scoundrel" in public. </p><p>Madoff's voice was a strange blend of Queens-accented Noo Yawk and a soft but firm monotone: "Your honor, for many years up until my arrest on December 11, 2008, I operated a Ponzi scheme. . . . I am actually grateful for this first opportunity to publicly speak about my crimes, for which I am so deeply sorry and ashamed. . . . I am painfully aware I have deeply hurt many, many people. </p><p>"When I began my Ponzi scheme, I believed it would end shortly and I would be able to extricate myself and my clients from the scheme. I am here today to accept responsibility for my crimes by pleading guilty and, with this plea allocution, explain the means by which I carried out and concealed my fraud. . . . I always knew this day would come. I never invested the money. I deposited it into a Chase Manhattan bank." </p><p>Madoff's statement took only about ten minutes, and while he spoke he did not turn to or eye the packed crowd in the gallery. When he finished, he sat down, and the courtroom broke out into a series of murmurs. Madoff would not have to spell out any details of his crime, nor would he implicate anyone else. There was just his guilty plea and no further explanation. </p><p>The tension crescendoed, for now it was time for three victims to make short statements. The first, George Nierenberg, took the podium and glared over at Madoff. </p><p>"I don't know if you've had a chance to turn around and look at the victims!" Nierenberg snapped. </p><p>Madoff then glanced over his shoulder, but Judge Chin admonished Nierenberg to return to the argument at hand. For what reason, if any, should the judge not accept Madoff's guilty plea, and not send him to jail? </p><p>A filmmaker whose family had lost everything, Nierenberg wanted to know why there was no conspiracy charge by the government &#x2014; surely there were other people who had helped Madoff in his decadeslong fraud who should be held accountable too. "He didn't commit this alone. I'm not suggesting that you reject the plea, but that there is another count to consider," Nierenberg said. Madoff had just said that the fraud had started in the early 1990s, but even the prosecutors disputed that claim, saying they thought it had started much earlier. </p><p>The second victim to address the court, Ronnie Sue Ambrosino, pointed out that the full extent of Madoff's crimes might never be uncovered if he was not forced to provide more information. Madoff's two sons, Mark and Andrew, and his brother, Peter, worked at the same firm too but had not been charged in the Ponzi scheme. </p><p>"Judge, I believe you have the opportunity today to find out where the money is and who else is involved in this crime," Ambrosino said. "And if this plea is accepted without those two pieces of information, I object to it being taken." </p><p>After the victims had made their statements, Judge Chin nodded and thanked them for speaking. Then he ordered Bernard Madoff remanded to prison. He would be sentenced three months later, in June 2009. </p><p>Applause broke out in the courtroom. The thief would not be going back to his million-dollar penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he had been under house arrest for the previous three months. </p><p><br>Outside the courthouse, at 500 Pearl Street, near the intersection of Pearl and Cardinal Hayes Place, the people who had invested with Madoff felt eerily unsatisfied. Some got a small thrill from seeing and hearing the metal handcuffs click around Madoff's wrists as Judge Chin ordered Madoff to prison for the first time since his confession to the FBI. </p><p>"He wasn't speaking the truth. It was a disgrace to the court," said Brian Felsen, a twenty-three-year-old Minnesotan whose grandfather had invested with Madoff in the 1980s. "I'm happy my grandfather didn't live to see this. His life's work was stolen. He would have been horrified." Felsen's family had come to Madoff through Minne apolis-based money manager Michael Engler, a pillar of the local Jewish community who'd also been duped by Madoff. "To see Madoff in the flesh . . ." Felsen said. "It opened the wound." </p><p>Other victims couldn't have cared less that Madoff had pleaded guilty and would probably go to jail for life &#x2014; the time he served would not repay the lives he hurt. Adriane Biondo of Los Angeles asked out loud on the sidewalk, among a crowd of reporters and Madoff victims, "Where's the money, Bernie?" </p> <p>Where was the money? It was a question that everyone across the nation &#x2014; and the world &#x2014; had been asking ever since news of the scam had broken. Was it in London, where two of Madoff's longtime fundraisers had set up an office? Was it in Switzerland, where Madoff had successfully courted Swiss banks like Safra Bank and Edgar de Picciotto's UBP? Was it in Asia, even, where Madoff had traveled in a desperate last bid to raise money before the scam unfolded? </p><p>Just three months earlier, Bernard L. Madoff had been relatively unknown outside of the close-knit circles of Wall Street. Now Madoff was a household name, a verb meaning "to rip off," as in, "I was Madoffed." His name was now equated with a crime bigger than Enron, bigger than WorldCom, bigger even than those of Charles Ponzi himself, the man whose name would grace the type of scheme that Madoff had taken to a whole new level. Madoff's crime spanned the world and involved tens of billions of dollars, all of which had seemingly vanished overnight. </p><p>Among financial traders on the Street and within the halls of the Securi...</p></p><h2>The Hummingbird and the Hawk: Conquest and Sovereignty in the Valley of Mexico 1503-1541 (Torchbooks TB1898)</h2><p>Book on the Spanish Conquests of Mexico</p><p></p><h2>Navy Woman (The Navy Series #4) (Silhouette Special Edition, No 683)</h2><p>Navy Woman by Debbie Macomber released on Jun 24, 2004 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Debbie Macomber is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction worldwide.

His radically new approach to the foundations of arithmetic, based on fresh definitions of the terms 'zero', 'one' and 'successor', revolutionized our understanding of mathematics. And his important insights into the nature of language and meaning provided the framework for Russell, Wittgenstein and twentieth-century linguistic analysis. In this superb survey of his evolving ideas, Anthony Kenny explains and assesses the full range of Frege's work and reveals why it still forms an ideal introduction to modern analytic philosophy. Even after seventy years, he concludes, Frege remains an absolutely central figure, one of those rare thinkers who wrote 'prose which is accessible and attractive on first acquaintance and yet which repays rereading over a lifetime'.</p><p>This accessible volume is a concise introduction to the work of Gottlieb Frege, one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century.This volume is a concise introduction to the thought of Gottlob Frege, one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. <p>The chapters follow Frege's thought in chronological sequence, from the nature of logic, proof and language in <i>Concept Scripts I and II,</i> to <i>The Foundations of Arithmetic, The Basic Laws of Arithmetic,</i> and finally <i>Logical Investigations.</i></p> <p>Written by Anthony Kenny, a leading figure in contemporary philosophy, this volume guides the reader through an accessible explanation and assessment of Frege's radical and lasting contributions to our understanding of language, meaning, and the foundations of arithmetic.</p></p><h2>Echoland</h2><p>June, 1940.

Gary Frank is one of comics&#39; most acclaimed and respected artists, with work including Avengers, Batman, Birds of Prey, Midnight Nation, Supergirl, Squadron Supreme, Supreme Power and Uncanny X-Men.Grade 9 Up&#x2013;Facing off once again with his old foe Brainiac, Superman is shocked to learn that the coldly logical supervillain was responsible for the disappearance of both an entire Kryptonian city and the death of hundreds of Kryptonians. When Brainiac turns his sights to Earth and adds the city of Metropolis to his collection of miniaturized specimens, the Man of Steel must confront a far more powerful and cruel opponent than he ever dreamed of, and Supergirl must overcome her own misgivings about her power in order to stop Brainiac's robotic minions from destroying the Earth. This somewhat standard tale of Superman confronting an evil alien bent on destroying the world is enlightened by realistic characters and dialogue as well as some heartrending displays of emotion. With a fair amount of graphic violence, this is a somewhat darker Superman than some audiences may be comfortable with; that said, the plot is sure to keep readers on the edge of their seats. The artwork is excellent, with wonderful use of color. A fine general choice for collections in need of solid superhero titles.<i>&#x2013;Dave Inabnitt, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was like trying to wrestle a king-�size mattress off a waterbed. So they buried him close to the house. Which made sense anyway. The harvest was still a month away, and a disturbance in a field would show up from the air. And they would use the air, for a guy like Keever. They would use search planes, and helicopters, and maybe even drones.<br><br>They started at midnight, which they thought was safe enough. They were in the middle of ten thousand acres of nothingness, and the only man-�made structure their side of any horizon was the railroad track to the east, but midnight was five hours after the evening train and seven hours before the morning train. Therefore, no prying eyes. Their backhoe had four spotlights on a bar above the cab, the same way kids pimped their pick-�up trucks, and together the four beams made a wide pool of halogen brightness. Therefore, visibility was not a problem either. They started the hole in the hog pen, which was a permanent disturbance all by itself. Each hog weighed two hundred pounds, and each hog had four feet. The dirt was always chewed up. Nothing to see from the air, not even with a thermal camera. The picture would white out instantly, from the steaming animals themselves, and their steaming piles and pools of waste.<br><br>Safe enough.<br><br>Hogs were rooting animals, so they made sure the hole was deep. Which was not a problem either. Their backhoe&#x2019;s arm was long, and it bit rhythmically, in fluent articulated seven-�foot scoops, the hydraulic rams glinting in the electric light, the engine straining and roaring and pausing, the cab falling and rising, as each bucket-�load was dumped aside. When the hole was done they backed the machine up and turned it around and used the front bucket to push Keever into his grave, scraping him, rolling him, covering his body with dirt, until finally it fell over the lip and thumped down into the electric shadows.<br><br>Only one thing went wrong, and it happened right then.<br><br>The evening train came through five hours late. The next morning they heard on the AM station that a broken locomotive had caused a jam a hundred miles south. But they didn&#x2019;t know that at the time. All they heard was the mournful whistle at the distant crossing, and then all they could do was turn and stare, at the long lit cars rumbling past in the middle distance, one after the other, like a vision in a dream, seemingly forever. But eventually the train was gone, and the rails sang for a minute more, and then the tail light was swallowed by the midnight darkness, and they turned back to their task.<br><br>Twenty miles north the train slowed, and slowed, and then eased to a hissing stop, and the doors sucked open, and Jack Reacher stepped down to a concrete ramp in front of a grain elevator as big as an apartment house. To his left were four more elevators, all of them bigger than the first, and to his right was an enormous metal shed the size of an airplane hangar. There were vapor lights on poles, set at regular intervals, and they cut cones of yellow in the darkness. There was mist in the nighttime air, like a note on a calendar. The end of summer was coming. Fall was on its way.<br><br>Reacher stood still and behind him the train moved away without him, straining, grinding, settling to a slow rat-�a-�tat rhythm, and then accelerating, its building slipstream pulling at his clothes. He was the only passenger who had gotten out. Which was not surprising. The place was no kind of a commuter hub. It was all agricultural. What token passenger facilities it had were wedged between the last elevator and the huge shed, and were limited to a compact building, which seemed to have both a ticket window and benches for waiting. It was built in a traditional railroad style, and it looked like a child&#x2019;s toy, temporarily set down between two shiny oil drums.<br><br>But on a sign board running its whole length was written the reason Reacher was there: Mother&#x2019;s Rest. Which he had seen on a map, and which he thought was a great name for a railroad stop. He figured the line must cross an ancient wagon train trail, right there, where something had happened long ago. Maybe a young pregnant woman went into labor. The jostling could not have helped. Maybe the wagon train stopped for a couple of weeks. Or a month. Maybe someone remembered the place years later. A descendant, perhaps. A family legend. Maybe there was a one-�room museum.<br><br>Or perhaps there was a sadder interpretation. Maybe they had buried a woman there. Too old to make it. In which case there would be a commemorative stone.<br><br>Either way Reacher figured he might as well find out. He had no place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, so detours cost him nothing. Which is why he got out of the train. To a sense of disappointment, initially. His expectations had been way off base. He had pictured a couple of dusty houses, and a lonely one-�horse corral. And the one-�room museum, maybe run part-�time and volunteer by an old guy from one of the houses. Or the headstone, maybe marble, behind a square wrought-�iron fence.<br><br>He had not expected the immense agricultural infrastructure. He should have, he supposed. Grain, meet the railroad. It had to be loaded somewhere. Billions of bushels and millions of tons each year. He stepped left and looked through a gap between structures. The view was dark, but he could sense a rough semicircle of habitation. Houses, obviously, for the depot workers. He could see lights, which he hoped were a motel, or a diner, or both.<br><br>He walked to the exit, skirting the pools of vapor light purely out of habit, but he saw that the last lamp was unavoidable, because it was set directly above the exit gate. So he saved himself a further perimeter diversion by walking through the next-�to-�last pool of light, too.<br><br>At which point a woman stepped out of the shadows.<br><br>She came toward him with a distinctive burst of energy, two fast paces, eager, like she was pleased to see him. Her body language was all about relief.<br><br>Then it wasn&#x2019;t. Then it was all about disappointment. She stopped dead, and she said, &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br><br>She was Asian. But not petite. Five-�nine, maybe, or even five-� ten. And built to match. Not a bone in sight. No kind of a willowy waif. She was about forty, Reacher guessed, with black hair worn long, jeans and a T-�shirt under a short cotton coat. She had lace-�up shoes on her feet.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Good evening, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br>She was looking past his shoulder.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the only passenger.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked him in the eye.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;No one else got out of the train. So I guess your friend isn&#x2019;t coming.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My friend?&#x201d; she said. A neutral kind of accent. Regular American. The kind he heard everywhere.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Why else would a person be here, except to meet the train? No point in coming otherwise. I guess normally there would be nothing to see at midnight.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;ve been waiting here since seven o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know the train was late,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no cell signal here. And no one from the railroad, to tell you anything. And I guess the Pony Express is out sick today.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t in my car. Or the next two, either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who wasn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your friend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what he looks like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a big guy,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you jumped out when you saw me. You thought I was him. For a second, anyway. And there were no big guys in my car. Or the next two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When is the next train?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seven in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br>She said, &#x201c;Who are you and why have you come here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just a guy passing through.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The train passed through. Not you. You got out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know anything about this place?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you seen a museum or a gravestone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s asking?&#x201d;<br><br>She paused a beat, and said, &#x201c;Nobody.&#x201d;<br><br>Reacher said, &#x201c;Is there a motel in town?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a motel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Works for me,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;Does it have vacancies?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be amazed if it didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK, you can show me the way. Don&#x2019;t wait here all night. I&#x2019;ll be up by first light. I&#x2019;ll knock on your door as I leave. Hopefully your friend will be here in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman said nothing. She just glanced at the silent rails one more time, and then turned around and led the way through the exit gate.</p><h2>Ten Rubber Duckies</h2><p><i>Ten Rubber Duckies</i> is from the same folks who created T<i>en Little Ladybugs and Good Night, Sweet Butterflies</i>&#x2013;two books that started a phenomenon, selling more than 1.5 million copies each.

Then&#x201a; at twenty-six&#x201a; she withdrew from stage and screen to marry a European</p></p><p>A respected biographer and theologian, Donald Spoto is the author of over twenty books, among them bestselling biographies of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Tennessee WilliamsOne: Off the Main Line<br><br>I never really felt pretty, bright or socially adept.&#x2014;Grace<br>In the late 1920s, the Hahnemann Medical College, at the corner of Broad and Vine Streets in Philadelphia, was one of the largest private hospitals in the United States. Unusual luxuries characterized the private rooms: a telephone and radio were installed at every bedside; nurses could be summoned and addressed by call-buttons and two-way speakers; and high-speed elevators whisked visitors to the wards. Although Hahnemann accepted emergency cases from every socioeconomic class, it catered, unofficially but famously, to the demands of the rich from the counties of eastern Pennsylvania.<br>Early in the morning of Tuesday, November 12, 1929, John B. Kelly escorted his wife, Margaret Majer Kelly, to Hahnemann, where, after an unexceptional labor, she bore her third child and second daughter. On December 1, the Kellys took the baby to St. Bridget&#x2019;s Roman Catholic Church, a three-minute, half-mile drive from their home in the upscale neighborhood of Philadelphia known as East Falls. The infant was baptized Grace Patricia, in memory of an aunt who had died young, and (so Grace Kelly believed) &#x201c;because I was Tuesday&#x2019;s child&#x201d;&#x2014;who, according to Mother Goose, was &#x201c;full of grace.&#x201d;<br><br>On the banks of the Schuylkill River, East Falls has always been a quiet residential neighborhood, known for its easy commute to downtown Philadelphia. The most respected, established families&#x2014;Protestants with &#x201c;old money&#x201d; like the Drexels, Biddles, Clarks, Cadwaladers and Wideners&#x2014;lived across the river, in western suburbs along the ?so-?called Main Line, in eighteen communities (among them, Overbrook, Merion, Wynnewood, Ardmore, Haverford, Bryn Mawr, Rosemont and Radnor). The river was very like a social dividing line.<br><br>But membership in Philadelphia&#x2019;s �lite depended more on history than geography: one was &#x201c;in society&#x201d; only if a family could be traced back to colonial times, before the War of Independence. The class distinctions were so immutable that the Kellys knew they would never be accepted into high society, no matter the extent of their wealth. The Kellys were Irish, Roman Catholic and Democrats; Philadelphia society was English, Episcopalian and Republican. &#x201c;We could have been members&nbsp;of the social register&#x2014;the so-called Four Hundred&#x2014;if we&#x2019;d wanted to,&#x201d; Grace Kelly&#x2019;s mother said. &#x201c;But we had other things to do.&#x201d; If she really believed this, she was astonishingly na�ve. Her husband knew otherwise; instead, he set out to &#x201c;do well&#x201d; in business, athletics and politics.<br><br>When Grace was born, the entire country was in the throes of a terrible financial crisis. At the end of October the stock market was in almost total collapse, signaling an economic disaster that led to the Great Depression. Scores of banks failed overnight; innumerable companies shut their doors forever; and millions of Americans were suddenly homeless and jobless, pitchforked into abject poverty and facing a future without prospects. The United States was steeped in despair, and newspapers chronicled a tragic epidemic of suicides.<br>Some families, however, were untouched by the gruesome facts of national life, and Grace&#x2019;s was among them. Her father, John B. Kelly, had never speculated in the stock market, and his wealth&#x2014;achieved in the construction trade during the boom time after the Great War&#x2014;was held in cash and government bonds. His seventeen-room brick mansion at 3901 Henry Avenue was set amid lush, undulating lawns, and the property featured a tennis court and elaborate recreational equipment for active children. The house was mortgage-free, like Kelly&#x2019;s seaside vacation home in Ocean City, New Jersey. The family sailed through the Depression enjoying a genteel, privileged life: the Kelly children attended private academies; there were household servants and workers to tend the grounds and gardens; and the children wore only the finest new seasonal wardrobes.<br><br>Grace had two older siblings: Margaret (&#x201c;Peggy&#x201d;), born in September 1925; and John junior (&#x201c;Kell&#x201d;), born in May 1927. The family was complete with the birth of Elizabeth Anne (&#x201c;Lizanne&#x201d;) in June 1933. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t a strong child like my sisters and brother,&#x201d; Grace said years later, &#x201c;and my family told me they thought I was practically born with a cold&#x2014;I was always sniffling and sneezing, clearing my throat and fighting some kind of respiratory ailment.&#x201d; Her mother routinely reserved the juices of the family roasts for fragile young Grace, in a constant effort to improve the child&#x2019;s strength and stamina.<br><br>&#x201c;My other children were the strong ones, the extroverts, but Gracie was shy and retiring,&#x201d; her mother recalled. &#x201c;She was also frail and sickly a good deal of the time.&#x201d; The girl filled the hours of her frequent confinements by making up stories and plays for her collection of dolls. &#x201c;Grace could change her voice for each doll, giving it a different character. She loved attention for all this, but she didn&#x2019;t cry if she didn&#x2019;t get it.&#x201d;<br><br>Thin and withdrawn, Grace preferred to read myths, fairy tales and books about dancers and dancing; indeed, her favorite dolls were fashioned like tiny ballerinas, complete with pointe shoes and delicate tutus. She also loved to read poetry and tried her hand at verses:<br>I hate to see the sun go downAnd squeeze itself into the ground,Since some warm night it might get stuckAnd in the morning not get up!<br>Grace was largely indifferent to physical activity: &#x201c;I liked to swim, but did my best to avoid other sports and games.&#x201d; This attitude made her something of an outsider. Her father had been an Olympic athlete, her mother a champion swimmer and physical education teacher, and their children were strongly&nbsp;encouraged&#x2014;indeed, they were expected&#x2014;to excel at competitive sports. Grace&#x2019;s preference for books and imaginative games did not go down well with her father, a man who had little interest in cultural or intellectual matters.<br><br>Born in 1889, John B. &#x201c;Jack&#x201d; Kelly was the youngest of ten children born to Irish immigrants. Quitting school in early adolescence, he worked in the family firm as a bricklayer while perfecting his skill at sculling (rowing on the river), and during army service in the World War, he became a champion boxer. Returning to civilian life, Jack rejoined his father&#x2019;s company, Kelly for Brickwork, and the postwar building boom of the 1920s quickly made him a millionaire. He did not, however, achieve this on his own, as he often implied, nor was he a self-made American success story. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve latched on to the bricklayer theme and won&#x2019;t let go of this Horatio Alger idea,&#x201d; said his brother George, who directly confronted Jack&#x2019;s self-glorification. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s all this talk about you getting callused hands laying bricks? The only times I remember you having calluses were from long hours of scull practice on the Schuylkill River!&#x201d;<br>Wealth freed Jack to spend those long hours rowing. After winning six national championships, he headed for the Henley Regatta in England, the most celebrated event in the sport of sculling. But in 1920 his application for inclusion was rejected at the last minute when the judges determined that his years of manual labor and muscular development as a bricklayer gave him an unfair advantage over &#x201c;gentleman&#x201d; athletes. The true reason for his dismissal, however, was that the English authorities did not want to risk giving a prize to an Irish-American Catholic. The consequential outcry was so loud that by 1937 the rules at Henley no longer excluded manual laborers, mechanics or artisans as unfit for the competition.<br><br>More determined than ever after this rejection, Kelly proceeded to the 1920 summer Olympics at Antwerp, Belgium, where he won a gold medal in the single scull and, half an hour later, a second gold medal in the double scull, in which he rowed with a cousin. His family later swore to the truth of the anecdote that he mailed his racing cap to King George V with the message, &#x201c;Greetings from a bricklayer.&#x201d; Four years later, during the summer of 1924, Kelly and his cousin repeated their success at the Paris Olympics&#x2014;an achievement that made &#x201c;the Irish bricklayer&#x201d; the first rower to win three Olympic gold medals. With that, he became one of the most famous athletes of his generation, and his name was included in the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. Later he was appointed National Physical Fitness Director by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who regarded him as a good friend.<br><br>Before his Paris triumph, Kelly renounced bachelorhood (but not his avocation as a womanizer) when he married Margaret Majer on January 30, 1924, at St. Bridget&#x2019;s Church. She was nine years his junior and as strikingly beautiful as he was darkly handsome. They had first met at a swim club, where she successfully competed; she was also one of Philadelphia&#x2019;s most successful cover-girl models. With her degree in physical education, she became the first woman to teach that field at the University of Pennsylvania and at Women&#x2019;s Medical College. She converted from Lutheranism to her fianc�&#x2019;s religion just before their wedding.<br><br>&#x201c;I had a good stiff German background,&#x201d; Margaret said years later. &#x201c;My parents believed in discipline and so do I&#x2014;no tyranny or anything like that, but a certain firmness.&#x201d; Proper appearances, unfailing decorum, the importance of manners: these were almost religious observances for Margaret Majer Kelly. She trained her children to control themselves, to hide pain and disappointment, to suppress their emotions in public, to disguise effort and to strive for perfection without seeming to do so. Her tutoring was more successful with Grace than with the others.<br><br>Margaret&#x2019;s discipline was apparently unremitting. Kell nicknamed her &#x201c;the Prussian general&#x201d; for her heavy hand, and Grace recalled her mother&#x2019;s insistence that her daughters learn not only the fine points of competitive sports but also those of sewing, cooking, dressmaking and gardening. &#x201c;My mother was the disciplinarian in our family,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My father was very gentle, never the one to spank or scold. My mother did that. But when my father spoke&#x2014;boy, you moved.&#x201d; Life among the Kellys was to be enjoyed by the constant development of new skills and by the quiet assumption of responsibilities, and Margaret&#x2019;s chief occupation became the training of her children. Jack, meanwhile, was involved in local politics, business, sports and a social (and amorous) life that excluded his family.<br><br>When Jack was at home, famous athletes from all over the world frequently visited. For the parents and for Peggy, Kell and Lizanne, these people were stimulating company; for Grace, they were tiresome and left her feeling more alienated than ever. &#x201c;I never really felt pretty, bright or socially adept, and all that talk of sports, politics and business left me cold.&#x201d; People often mistook Grace&#x2019;s shyness for an attitude of superiority and, later, of snobbery. The truth was that, in addition to her quite different interests and hobbies, she was exceedingly nearsighted: without her hated glasses, very little was clear and she could not recognize people. &#x201c;She was so myopic she couldn&#x2019;t see ten feet in front of her&#x201d; without glasses, recalled Howell Conant, who later became her favorite photographer.<br><br>Grace&#x2019;s estimation of herself was also formed by her father&#x2019;s favoritism, and this, as with any child, caused her some insecurity. &#x201c;My older sister was my father&#x2019;s favorite,&#x201d; Grace reflected years later, &#x201c;and then there was the boy, the only son. Then I came. After that, I had a baby sister, and I was terribly jealous of the attention she got. I was always on my mother&#x2019;s knee, the clinging type. But I was pushed away [by my mother], and so I resented my sister for years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of the four children, Peggy was Jack&#x2019;s favorite,&#x201d; recalled Dorothea Sitley, a longtime family friend. &#x201c;Grace was the introvert, the quiet, serene one, and she felt left out. It was always Peggy and her father together.&#x201d; Jack admitted his preference for his firstborn child: &#x201c;I thought it would be Peggy whose name would be up in lights one day. Anything that Grace could do, Peggy could always do better&#x201d;&#x2014;or so he thought.<br><br>&#x201c;According to him, Peggy was destined to be the star of the family,&#x201d; recalled Grace&#x2019;s close friend and publicist, Rupert Allan (later also the Mon�gasque consul general in Los Angeles). &#x201c;Jack never paid much attention to Grace&#x2014;he accepted her, but he never understood her. But she adored him and always sought his approval.&#x201d; Jack Kelly was &#x201c;a very nice man,&#x201d; recalled Grace&#x2019;s friend Judith Balaban Kanter Quine, &#x201c;but he was a man without much sensitivity.&#x201d;<br><br>As much as she must have been aware of her father&#x2019;s preference for Peggy, Grace longed for her older sister&#x2019;s approval as much as for his. &#x201c;I used to help my sister sell flowers to passersby to raise money for my mother&#x2019;s pet charity, Women&#x2019;s Medical College and Hospital of Pennsylvania. Naturally, most of our customers were the neighbors. Little did they know that some of the flowers came from their own gardens. I used to be sent by my big sister Peggy to raid the nearby gardens at night, and quite unashamedly we sold these same flowers back to their owners next morning.&#x201d;<br><br>Just as she tried to befriend her sister, &#x201c;Grace admired her father,&#x201d; according to her close friend, the actress Rita Gam. &#x201c;But she thought he really never appreciated her. He always preferred Peggy and never approved of Grace&#x2019;s career&#x2014;and her mother was a very tough lady, rather critical and not terribly warm. Both her parents said they were surprised and puzzled by Grace&#x2019;s later success. When she talked about this, there was a certain wistfulness in her voice, but she was an extremely loyal person and very protective of her family.&#x201d; What might be called Grace&#x2019;s marginal status in a family of hardy, rah-rah competitors evoked a touching desire for demonstrative affection. &#x201c;As a child,&#x201d; recalled her sister Lizanne, &#x201c;she loved to be held and cuddled and kissed.&#x201d; This longing for physical tokens of affection increased with the years.<br><br>Grace and her father remained virtual strangers to each other until his death in 1960. She never addressed the topic directly, but she said that her father liked to be with rough, ?self-?confident children who could tumble on a playing field and bounce right back up. The implication was clear: that was not a description of Grace at any age, and she felt outside the orbit of his approval. Judy Quine agreed: &#x201c;Jack Kelly ?didn&#x2019;t cozy up to Grace. He understood business, politics and sports. He knew what these things were about, but he never &#x2018;got it&#x2019; about Grace. Toward the end of his life, he accepted her. He saw her impact on the world and he showed her some respect. That&#x2019;s what they shared at the end of his life&#x2014;deep respect.&#x201d;<br><br>It was perhaps inevitable, then, that a senior family servant named Godfrey Ford became something of a father figure. Addressed as &#x201c;Fordie,&#x201d; he was the Kelly chauffeur and factotum, evoking enormous affection from all the youngsters&#x2014;and especially from Grace. &#x201c;He kept their cars polished,&#x201d; recalled the Kellys&#x2019; childhood friend Elaine Cruice Beyer. &#x201c;He could serve, put on a big party, supervise bartenders and buffets and keep the gardens in beautiful condition.&#x201d; Grace&#x2019;s respect and fondness for the African-American Fordie instilled in her a lifelong hatred of racism.<br><br>On Thursdays, when the children's nanny was off duty, Fordie was entrusted with the task of putting the children to bed. "gracie asked my opinions about this and that," he recalled years later. "I'd tell her what I thought, and she'd usually follow my advice." later he gave her driving lessons in front of the house and in the long driveway, "but she was never good at parking."<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Witch&#39;s Dream</h2><p>An anthropologist recounts her experiences after joining a group of witches in northern Venezuela and describes what they taught her about sorcery, witchcraft and healing</p><p><b>Florinda Donner-Grau</b>&nbsp;is an American anthropologist and writer, whose books include&nbsp;<i>The Witch&#x2019;s Dream: A Healer&#x2019;s Way of Knowledge</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers&#x2019; World</i>.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Carlos Castaneda</b> was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, gathering information on various medicinal herbs used by the Indians in Sonora, Mexico, when he met the old Yaqui Indian Don Juan.

With its thin atmosphere, rocky canyons, extinct volcanoes, and icy polar regions, Mars has many things in common with Earth. Water once flowed over its surface, and there exists the possibility that life may have begun there. Comparing the two planets&#39; evolution, geology, and geography, the authors explain what we know about Mars today-and what we hope to learn about Mars in the future, including whether primitive life does exist somewhere beneath its barren surface. The Mystery of Mars is an engaging and accessible introduction to the Red Planet, and the ideal guide to the coming age of Mars exploration.</p><p>SALLY RIDE has been interested in science since she was a child. She earned bachelor s degrees in physics and English and a Ph.D. in physics from Stanford University. In 1983 she became the first American woman to fly in space, when she made a six-day flight aboard the space shuttle Challenger. She made her second trip into space in 1984. Dr. Ride is now a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. She is also founder of Sally Ride Science, a company that creates innovative programs and publications for young people interested in science. TAM O SHAUGHNESSY and Sally Ride have been friends since they were teens competing in junior tennis tournaments. Dr. O Shaughnessy holds a master s degree in biology and a Ph.D. in school psychology from the University of California, Riverside. She is a professor of school psychology at San Diego State University. Tam and Sally have written four other children s science books including The Third Planet: Exploring The Earth From Space, winner of the American Institute of Physics Children s Science Writing Award.From Florida Today Ride revisits her Mars book New edition boasts graphics and imaginative paintings CAPE CANAVERAL - NASA&#39;s Spirit and Opportunity rovers have revolutionized what we know about the planet Mars, an object of ongoing human fascination. Rolling along on opposite sides of the planet, the robotic geologists have uncovered concrete evidence Mars once was awash with water. And that raises the real possibility that further exploration might yield signs of past -- or present -- primitive life. Coupled with NASA&#39;s new push to send astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars, the important scientific findings prompted former astronaut Sally Ride to release a new edition of &#34;The Mystery of Mars,&#34; a book first published in 1996. It was written with co-author Tam O&#39;Shaughnessy, an award-winning science writer. &#34;It&#39;s actually a revised and updated version of the book we wrote in the 1990s,&#34; Ride, who became the first American woman to fly in space in 1983, wrote in an e-mail. &#34;But two rovers and a new strategic plan later, it was time to update it!&#34; Written for readers ages 9 and older, &#34;The Mystery of Mars&#34; draws on data from rovers and other spacecraft to paint a vivid portrait of a planet &#34;that is starkly beautiful, but cold, dry and desolate,&#34; Ride and O&#39;Shaughnessy write. &#34;There is no water on its surface, no oxygen in its atmosphere, and no life in its soil. But we also see clues that ancient Mars was very different. Long, long ago, Mars was a warmer planet, perhaps with thick clouds, ice-covered lakes, and maybe even primitive microscopic life.&#34; It&#39;s an excellent, introductory primer on the fourth planet from the sun -- a richly detailed look at Mars that is both engaging and scientifically accurate. It&#39;s also a visual extravaganza. Colorful computer graphics, imaginative paintings and stunning photographs from rovers and other spacecraft illustrate a rugged red world with gigantic volcanoes, yawning canyons and bone dry riverbeds.

These two novels, written in the 1970s, display Aleshkovsky&#x2019;s linguistic gifts and keen observations of Soviet life.<br><br><i>Nikolai Nikolaevich</i> begins when its titular hero, a pickpocket by trade, is released from prison after World War II and finds a job in a Moscow biological laboratory. Starting out as a kind of janitor, he is soon recruited to provide sperm for strange experiments intended to create life in the Andromeda galaxy. The hero finds himself at the center of the 1948 purge of biological science in the Soviet Union, in a transgressive tale that joins science fiction (and science fact) with gulag slang and a love story. The protagonist and narrator of <i>Camouflage</i> is an alcoholic who claims that he and his gang of friends are just one part of a vast camouflaging operation organized by the Party to hide the Soviet Union&#x2019;s underground military-industrial complex from the CIA&#x2019;s spy satellites. As they pass their time on the streets and share their alcohol-inspired fantasies, they see the stark reality of the Cold War in Russia in the late seventies. <i>Nikolai Nikolaevich and Camouflage</i> introduces English-speaking readers to a master of the comic first-person narrative.</p><p>Yuz Aleshkovsky was born in 1929 in Krasnoyarsk and grew up in Moscow. He served in the Soviet navy and was imprisoned from 1950 to 1953 for &#x201c;violating discipline.&#x201d; He published children&#x2019;s books but became best known for his songs and novels circulated in samizdat before he emigrated to the United States in 1979. His works in English include <i>The Hand </i>(1989) and <i>Kangaroo</i> (1999).<br><br>Duffield White is professor emeritus of Russian, East European, and Eurasian studies at Wesleyan University.

Taft Professor of Modern Languages and professor of Russian, East European, and Eurasian studies at Wesleyan University. She is the translator of <i>Trepanation of the Skull</i> by Sergey Gandlevsky (2014).Joseph Brodsky once noted that Aleshkovsky had a Mozartian ear for the Russian language, and <i>Nikolai Nikolaevich</i> (1970), his first novel, as well as <i>Camouflage</i> (1978), his fourth &#x2013; written the year before the author emigrated permanently to the US &#x2013; are indeed virtuoso performances. . . . Staying faithful to Aleshkovsky&#x2019;s foul-mouthed muse, White&#x2019;s translation, edited by Fusso, mines the rich muck of anglophone cussing with evident glee, and the effect is delightful. (Boris Dralyuk <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>Rescued from the literary underground, these two historical novellas provide a coarse satirical insight into post-World War II Soviet dissatisfaction. Aleshkovsky emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1979 as an infamous writer of imaginative dissident fiction. . . . Through his two scurrilous antiheroes, Aleshkovsky laughs at Russian society from the gutters of the Soviet underworld. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>Forget old myths about censored, obedient Soviet citizens, and meet Aleshkovsky&#x2019;s wildly enterprising and emphatically free-thinking protagonists who don&#x2019;t hesitate to use colorful language to make a point about body politics, the scientific use of semen, and other absurdities of modern life. (Yvonne Howell, University of Richmond)<br><br>Completely irreverent &#x2015; in the best possible way. Underneath the biting satire and the unrelenting hilarity, Yuz Aleshkovsky's rapid-fire prose reveals intricate insights into late Soviet politics, culture, science, and daily life. The deeply problematic narrators of both novellas will introduce you to a Soviet Union you hadn't suspected existed. (Michael Gordin, Princeton University)<br><br>Yuz Aleshkovsky is absolutely brilliant.

(<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>Days of Awe: A novel</h2><p>Celebrated for her irresistibly witty, strikingly intelligent examinations of friendship and marriage, Lauren Fox (&#x201c;An immensely gifted writer&#x2014;a writer adept at capturing the sad-funny mess that happens to be one woman&#x2019;s life&#x201d; &#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i>) has written her most powerful novel to date. <i>Days of Awe </i>is the story of a woman who, in the wake of her best friend&#x2019;s sudden death, must face the crisis in her marriage, the fury of her almost-teenage daughter, and the possibility of opening her cantankerous heart to someone new.<br><br> Only a year ago Isabel Moore was married, was the object of adoration for her ten-year-old daughter, and thought she knew everything about her wild, extravagant, beloved best friend, Josie. But in that one short year her husband moved out and rented his own apartment; her daughter grew into a moody insomniac; and Josie&#x2014;impulsive, funny, secretive Josie&#x2014;was killed behind the wheel in a single-car accident. As the relationships that long defined Isabel&#x2014;wife, mother, daughter, best friend&#x2014;change before her eyes, Isabel must try to understand who she really is. <br><br> Teeming with longing, grief, and occasional moments of wild, unexpected joy, <i>Days of Awe</i> is a daring, dazzling book&#x2014;a luminous exploration of marriage, motherhood, and the often surprising shape of new love.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2015:</strong> <em>Days of Awe</em> could be maudlin, it could be filled with clich�s about loss and floundering in midlife, worse: it could be dull. Instead, it's wry, smart, shiny, and bright--filled with observations about grief and loss that will make you sit up and begin to underline. In the span of a year Isabel Moore's life comes crashing down: her best friend Josie dies; her marriage crumbles; Hannah, her "sad, snarling wolf cub of a girl" turns against her and she's left to pick up the pieces. In coping with her new life, where "the silence in the house came alive, grew feral" Isabel slides and slips from narrating her present to remembering her past &#x2013; from the spark of meeting someone new to an eighth grade history assignment, from her husband packing his bags to their troubles conceiving, from her weekly bawdy confessionals with Josie to uncovering Josie's secrets after her death. Despite its hard-hitting and heart-hurting subject matter, Lauren Fox (the accomplished author of <em>Friends Like Us</em> and <em>Still Life With Husband</em> delivers a witty, moving and enjoyable portrait of how motherhood, marriage, friendship and memories keep you barreling forward. <em>&#x2013;Al Woodworth</em></p><p><b>LAUREN FOX</b> is the author of the novels <i>Still Life with Husband</i> and <i>Friends Like Us</i>.

It is known for its intuitive, conversational style and for being able to tie together many of the important ideas in corporate finance. The author&#39;s discussions and illustrations are unique due to the depth of detail blended with a distinct sense of humor. This new edition will continue to be authoritative and student friendly but will also carry stronger, modern coverage reflected by current examples and data as well as unique emphasis upon agency issues.</p><p></p><h2>When It Happens to You</h2><p>When betrayal comes it takes many forms. A husband&#39;s betrayal of a wife, a mother&#39;s betrayal of her son, a women betrayed by the loss of her soulmate. When it comes it will take you by surprise. But it will happen. And when it happens everything will change. You may not know it now, but when it happens to you, you will understand.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2012</strong>: Any lingering Brat Pack associations you may bring to <em>When It Happens to You</em>, Molly Ringwald&#x2019;s first novel, will rapidly evaporate. Ringwald renders the families and lovers in her intertwined stories with a compassionate eye for the kind of heartbreak that upends reality, as well as a keen sense of the more subtle ways in which trust breaks and mends. Each of her eight stories explores the dynamics of fidelity and betrayal, from &#x201c;The Harvest Moon&#x201d;--which illuminates the night a mother realizes the fickle nature of her daughter, her husband, and her own body--to &#x201c;Mea Culpa,&#x201d; where we see the erosion of her husband&#x2019;s desire, to the gut punch of a title story. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em><p>When it happens to you, you will be surprised. That thing they say about how you knew all the time, but just weren't facing it? That might be the case, but nevertheless, there you will be.</p><p>Molly Ringwald mines the complexities of modern relationships in this gripping and nuanced collection of interlinked stories. Writing with a deep compassion for human imperfection, Ringwald follows a Los Angeles family and their friends and neighbors while they negotiate the hazardous terrain of everyday life&#x2014;revealing the deceptions, heartbreak, and vulnerability familiar to us all.</p><p>In "The Harvest Moon," a stay-at-home mom grapples with age, infertility, and an increasingly distant husband. In "Ursa Minor," a former children's television star tries to rebuild his life after being hospitalized for "exhaustion." An elderly woman mourns the loss of her husband and her estranged relationship with her daughter in "The Little One." In "My Olivia," a single mother finds untapped reserves of strength to protect her flamboyant six-year-old son who wishes only to wear dresses and be addressed as Olivia. And in the devastating title story, a betrayed wife chronicles her pain and alienation, leading to an eviscerating denouement.</p><p>As the lives of these characters converge and diverge in unexpected ways, Ringwald reveals a startling eye for the universality of loss, love, and the search for connection. An unflinching yet poignant examination of the intricacies of the human heart, <em>When It Happens to You</em> is an auspicious literary debut.</p></p><h2>Keep Looking!</h2><p>As the reader turns the page, a new animal is added to an illustration of a country home in the winter.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 2-- After inviting readers into a country landscape, the authors explore the common and often overlooked animal life abundant there. Children are encouraged to look for signs of wild creatures, including many species of birds, reptiles, and rodents; the cocoon of next spring's moth and the eggs of next year's spiders; and a variety of animals such as deer, bats, and raccoons. The full-page watercolor illustrations realistically portray animals in snowy scenes during the day and through the night and are unusually appealing. The last page functions as an index of sorts, alphabetically listing the animals which appear and on which pages they can be found. Preschool and early elementary teachers will find many uses for this book, since the illustrations are large enough to be shared with a group, and the text is sufficiently abbreviated to function as a reader for beginners who have mastered basic skills. Children will look at the winter landscape in a different way after spending time with this treasure. --Ellen Fader, Westport Public Library, Conn.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is the 30th book that Selsam and Hunt have written together; but in this particular collaboration it is Chartier's art that steals the show. Well-defined watercolor paintings show a rural house and snowy, forested yard. Everything is still in the first spread, but in successive pictures, readers discover birds, insects, reptiles and mammals. Many of these creatures are attracted to man-made amenities such as the woodpile and the birdfeeder; bats emerge from the attic at night, and raccoons raid the garbage. The story maintains credibility because the animals never appear in incompatible groupings or large numbers. Though not especially inventive, this is a pleasant, lovely book; text and pictures easily shift from the large scene to close-ups and back again. Ages 5-8. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wanted Man: In Search of Bob Dylan</h2><p>"Wanted Man: In Search of Bob Dylan" is packed with articles and interviews offering insight into the poet laureate of the sixties generation and a man Life magazine recently named among the 100 most important Americans of the twentieth century. <p>This collection includes photos, many never before published, tracing Bob Dylan's entire career, plus interviews with people who have been closest to him-- such as Bonnie Beecher, the original "girl from the north country"-- and a number of major figures who have worked with Dylan and been influenced by him: Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Patti Smith, Ron Wood, and many others. The book spans Dylan's entire career, from his enrollment at the University of Minnesota in 1959 to his work with producer Daniel Lanois on "Oh Mercy", his most acclaimed album in years. </p><p>There have been many books written about this creative genius whose songs are the anthems of a generation-- especially during the fiftieth anniversary of his birth-- but only "Wanted Man: In Search of Bob Dylan" conveys the immediacy and humor which is so much a part of the experience of listening to his music.</p></p><p></p><h2>Girl Groups: The Story of a Sound</h2><p>Follows the history of the girl singing groups and singers of the sixties, including the Shangri-Las, the Supremes, and Lesley Gore, and explains how this particular style of music developed</p><p></p><h2>Apostles and the Emerging Apostolic Movement</h2><p>Did the spiritual office of apostle cease with the early Church? What does the Bible say about the continuation of this little understood but fascinating gift? Dr. David Cannistraci has produced the first definitive book on the subject of modern-day apostles-those gifted especially to plant, nurture and mobilize groups of churches in Christ-directed networks of Kingdom ministry. Apostles and the Emerging Apostolic Movement provides a carefully constructed and thorough biblical rationale for the continuing presence of this office today. God is not only raising up apostles, but a movement of ordinary people who are apostolic-Christians who are dynamically involved in active, bold ministry that focuses on the planting and nurturing of churches and productive ministry.</p><p>David Cannistraci is the Co-Pastor of Evangel Christian Fellowship in San Jose, California where he assists his uncle, Dr. Emanuele Cannistraci in the oversight of the growing congregation and it&#39;s network of churches and ministries.

David and his wife, Kathy, reside in San Jose with their two sons, Aaron and Jordan.</p><h2>By Grief Transformed: Dreams and the Mourning Process</h2><p>In her first year of training at the C.G. Jung Institute (Zurich), Susan Olson suffered the loss of her college-age daughter in a hit-and-run auto accident. By Grief Transformed describes her journey through mourning, guided by a series of vivid and startling dreams. Jung&#39;s definition of the dream as a harbinger of fate, a portent and comforter, the messenger of the gods evolves from academic theory into embodied insight in this chronicle of one woman&#39;s encounter with the transforming power of grief. From personal story, this book expands to include premonitory and grief dreams of other mourners, dreams cited in Jung&#39;s memoirs, and selections from mythology and literature. Classical and contemporary writers provide their unique perspectives, and illustrations from ancient and modern art enhance the text. On the archetypal level, the Greek myth of the goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone evokes the universal and timeless experience of loss and renewal in the crucible of grief. The dreams and stories recounted in this book, together with some provocative hints from Jung&#39;s work, suggest that death may usher us through the open door into a world beyond time and space. Dreams of the dead comfort the bereaved, offer tantalizing glimpses of the hereafter, and deepen our reverence for the eternal mystery of death and rebirth.</p><p>Susan Olson, a graduate of the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich, Switzerland, has practiced as a psychotherapist and Jungian analyst for over thirty years. She received her B.A. in English from Smith College, her M.A. in English from the University of Wisconsin, and her M.S.W. from the University of Georgia. A member of the Inter-Regional Society of Jungian analysts, she is a founding member of the Georgia Society of Jungian Analysts and is on the faculty of the Memphis Jungian Seminar. In addition to her private practice, she lectures and leads seminars on several topics. Dreams and the mourning process, the hero&#39;s (and heroine&#39;s) journey in The Lord of the Rings, feminine and masculine individuation in The Phantom of the Opera, and our soulful companionship with animals are among her favorites.<p>C.G. Jung characterized his psychology as an attempt, &#x201c;ever renewed, to give an answer to the question of the interplay between &#x2018;here&#x2019; and &#x2018;hereafter&#x2019;.&#x201d;&nbsp; Inspired by her own bereavement, Susan Olson soulfully engages this same interplay.&nbsp; Grappling now with the starkness of loss, now with the richness of death, she gives her answer to the &#x201c;here&#x201d; and &#x201c;hereafter&#x201d; question.&nbsp; A book of love and mystery.&nbsp; Highly recommended!</p> <p><b>--Greg Mogenson</b></p> Jungian analyst, teacher, and author of <i>Greeting the Angels: Angels: An Imaginal View of the Mourning Process</i></p><h2>Tent Boxing: An Australian Journey</h2><p><p>When Wayne McLennan was growing up in a sleepy Australian mining town in the 1950s, the most exciting event of the year was the arrival of Jimmy Sharman's boxing tent. Boxers would stand on a raised platform and challenge the local men and boys to fight. Aside from providing entertainment, these events challenged preconceptions about Aboriginals, who made up the bulk of Sharman's fighters. Decades later, McLennan returned to Australia to find that a few tents were still in operation in the remote, northern part of the country. This is McLennan&#x2019;s thrilling memoir of joining with one of the tents and traveling with the group as a driver, referee, and occasional fighter. In the process of finding out what makes a man fight for money, McLennan learned even more about Australia&#x2019;s troubled cultural past and the current mood of social relations and his fellow countrymen.</p></p><p><p>Wayne McLennan is the author of <i>Rowing to Alaska</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book.</p>* By the author of Rowing to Alaska: And Other True Stories * Praise for Rowing to Alaska: * &#39;A writer of rare force and scope&#39; Anthony Sattin, Sunday Times Books of the Year * &#39;A truly exciting writer, brave enough to show how complex men can be&#39; Independent on Sunday * &#39;Not only has he managed to recall vividly a series of rough-and-ready tales- he has done so, entertainingly, with a minimum of soul- searching and a maximum of no- nonsense storytelling&#39; Times Literary Supplement</p><h2>Michael Wolf: The Transparent City</h2><p>Chicago, like many urban centers throughout the world, has recently undergone a surge in new construction, grafting a new layer of architectural experimentation onto those of past eras. In early 2007, the Museum of Contemporary Photography, with the support of U.S. Equities Realty, invited Michael Wolf as an artist-in-residence to document this phenomenon. Bringing his unique perspective on changing urban environments to a city renowned for its architectural legacy, Wolf chose to photograph the central downtown area, focusing specifically on issues of voyeurism and the contemporary urban landscape in flux. This is Wolf&#39;s first body of work to address an American city. Whereas prior series have juxtaposed humanizing details within the surrounding geometry of the urban landscape, in The Transparent City, his details are fragments of life--digitally distorted and hyper-enlarged--snatched surreptitiously via telephoto lenses: Edward Hopper meets Blade Runner. The material</p><p>"...by turns they [the images] dazzle and unsettle. The color images are mostly of contemporary buildings downtown. However, they are more about geometric abstraction and voyeurism than architectural photography. As the text says, Edward Hopper meets 'Blade Runner.' Riveting." -- Alan Artner --Chicago Tribune<br><br>"The book... combines impersonal cityscapes shot primarily at dusk or at night with details of the buildings' inhabitants that become impressionistic because of the pixilation from extreme enlargement. Mr. Wolf added some close-up photographs with a 300-millimeter lens. Together they reveal what is hidden in the broader architectural overviews." -- James Estrin --New York Times, Lens Blog<br><br>"On the one hand, Wolf's 'Transparent City' pictures ignite our smoldering anxieties about surveillance and the end of privacy. On the other, the complexities they describe so lucidly assert the ultimate incomprehensibility of the world." -- Kenneth Baker --San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"We are often told that the excitement of living in a city comes from the street. Wolf removes himself from that noisy world and makes his case for the cooler pleasures of observing from a safe distance the almost glacial stillness of urban life." -- Charles Dee Mitchell --Photo-Eye Magazine<br><br>"The business guy holding a green stress ball (seen in close-up and framed by his window and drapes) is a blob of protoplasm. In a day or a year or 30 years, he'll be gone, and another blob will replace him. His building, these photos seem to say, will remain." -- Patrick T. Reardon --Chicago Tribune MagazineThe ground is nowhere in sight in Wolf&#x2019;s dramatically geometric, nearly abstract photographs of Chicago&#x2019;s Loop towers. Shot from strategically selected rooftops and perfectly printed in an aptly large, vertical book, Wolf&#x2019;s subtly modulated color photographs are monumental studies in grays, whites, blacks, golds, and occasional splashes of green and blue. Given their elegant grids, nuanced variations, and stillness, these images echo the minimalist paintings of Agnes Martin, yet this is the real world, and real people inhabit these immense cellular buildings, these boxy hives, these human filing cabinets, and Wolf&#x2019;s stealthy, intrusive lens finds them, most often alone contemplating a television or computer. The lighting is exquisitely moody, each lit interior is a screen or stage, each human figure as poignant as those in the paintings of Edward Hopper, an artist Wolf, acclaimed for his earlier books on China, cites as an influence. With intimations of surveillance and vulnerability, these intensely beautiful cityscapes seem austere and inhuman&nbsp;until one lands on a magnified picture of a man giving the distant photographer the finger. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Buzby to the Rescue (An I Can Read Book)</h2><p>Buzby the hotel cat does his best to help visiting movie star Serena Lovejoy keep track of her jewels and enjoy her stay at the hotel</p><p>Julia Hoban's books for children include the I Can Read Books <em>Buzby </em>and <em>Buzby to the Rescue</em>, both illustrated by John Himmelman.

When Buzby overhears two guests (an alligator and a mouse) talking about "getting it" he surmises that they are up to no good. And when her royal ruby disappears, he is sure he has identified the thieves. The shady looking pair turn out to be autograph seekers, and Buzby's love of cream (even if it is "cold cream") helps him uncover the missing jewel.

The white terrier who found a home with Fred and Lucy in <i>McDuff Moves In</i> gets lost again when he sees a rabbit in the neighbor's yard and chases him "over hills and streets and flower beds" and into Mrs. Higgins' garden. The matronly Mrs. Higgins puts him in the sidecar of her red motorcycle and is driving him into town, when McDuff recognizes the smells, the sounds, and the sight of home. All four characters enjoy a splendid picnic together. Like the first book, this one features a 1930s period setting, an appealing little dog, and a consistent and believable portrayal of the canine point of view. The double-page spreads showing multiple images, such as the one in which McDuff chases the rabbit, raises questions of whether young children will understand that this is one pair of animals shown many times, rather than many dogs and rabbits chasing one another. Still, the bold shapes and colors of the artwork are one of the book's main drawing points. A mildly quirky picture book, just right for little dog lovers. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i>PreS. McDuff, an all-too-curious Yorkshire terrier, finds himself far from home when a rabbit in the next yard proves to be too much temptation and he takes off after it. The rabbit outwits him, though, and the small dog suddenly realizes that he's lost. Help comes in the form of a lively senior citizen who finds the wayward pup and takes him home (with directions from McDuff) on her motorcycle. Wells is a master at the delicate art of story, and Jeffers's realistic illustrations are wonderfully enticing. They successfully depict the curiosity that got McDuff into trouble in the first place, the penitent look when the elderly woman finds him, and the excitement of reunion. Children will revel in this second story about this endearing pup.?Christy Norris, Valley Cottage Library, NY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dressmaking With Liberty</h2><p>Supplies complete directions and patterns for making dresses, skirts, shirts, trousers, jackets, lingerie, and a baby&#39;s romper suit</p><p></p><h2>Sanji and the Baker</h2><p>Every morning and evening, Sanji sniffs the delicious smells that rise from the bakery below. When the Baker accuses Sanji of stealing his smells, and takes him to court, Sanji must figure a way out of a delicate situation, which he does with a very creative judge's help.<br> This humorous and imaginative picture book for young readers, set in the Middle East, asserts the simple moral that you can't put a monetary price on the simple pleasures of the senses. Beautiful illustrations by Korky Paul, the illustrator for <em>Winnie in Winter</em>, guarantee that Sanji and the Baker will be a popular choice for children and for reading aloud.</p><p><br><strong>Robin Tzannes</strong> lives in New York City. <strong>Korky Paul</strong> lives in the UK.<br>Kindergarten-Grade 4?Sanji travels the world until the day he happens upon the city of Fratsia. He finds a place to live above the baker's shop, where tempting smells fill the air. Day after day, morning and evening, Sanji stands on his balcony and enjoys the delicious aroma of cinnamon buns, fresh bread, and tasty cakes. When he refuses to pay the baker for the smells he is "stealing," the angry man takes Sanji to court. The judge directs Sanji to return with five silver coins. The next morning, Sanji throws the coins into a copper bowl one at a time. The judge then asks the baker, "Did you hear those coins clatter and clink? ...that was your payment." The illustrations are rendered in an exaggerated manner reminiscent of those in Mad Magazine with a sort of Middle Eastern setting. Grinning camels and a strange mix of characters (Sanji borrows money from a pirate, a wizard, and what appear to be the author and illustrator) reinforce the wacky story line while providing added visual interest. This book serves up just desserts and laughter suitable for school-age storytime and independent reading.<br><i>Susan M.

Churchill (1874-1965) has been called by historians &#34;the man of the twentieth century.&#34; Prime Minister of Great Britain (1940-1945), Churchill won the Nobel prize for literature in 1953.Churchill not only ranks in the minds of many as the man of the century: he can lay fair claim to being its finest orator. There are various selections of his speeches, some of which are quite comprehensive (among them a series edited by Randolph S. Churchill, including In the Balance: Speeches 1949-50, 1952; and Stemming the Tide: Speeches 1951 and 1952, LJ 1/15/54), but this may well be the best. Certainly the choices made by Cannadine (history, Columbia) are judicious, but what sets the present work apart is his sparkling introduction. Written with a verve worthy of its subject, it gives a fine picture of Churchill as a speaker. Appropriately, the inspirational wartime messages take pride of place here, but the man's whole career is nicely represented. Essential for both public and academic libraries.<br><i>- James A.

It is something of a mixed bag, because Norton wrote comparatively little short fiction and because, of Asimov's host of short pieces, the only major one included is "The Martian Way." On the other hand, Bester's stories haven't been reprinted nearly often enough, except for "Fondly Fahrenheit" (which reappears here). Furthermore, Clarke and Bradbury are represented by mixtures of well-known classics and superior but less well known pieces. Finally, in the separate author introductions, Grand Master Pohl cogently remarks on his peers. So although this may not be the most useful acquisition for collections possessing shelves of anthologies already, it ranks high in readability and sf historical and critical interest. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Mojo and Other Plays</h2><p>Jez Butterworth burst onto the theatre scene aged twenty-five with Mojo, one of the most dazzling Royal Court main stage debuts in years&#x201d; (<i>Time Out</i>).

Champion of what he called "termite art" (focused, often eccentric virtuosity as opposed to "white elephant" monumentality), master of a one-of-a-kind prose style whose jazz-like phrasing and incandescent twists and turns made every review an adventure, he has long been revered by his peers. Susan Sontag called him "the liveliest, smartest, most original film critic this country ever produced"; for Peter Bogdanovich, he was "razor-sharp in his perceptions" and "never less than brilliant as a writer."<br><br>Farber was an early discoverer of many filmmakers later acclaimed as American masters: Val Lewton, Preston Sturges, Samuel Fuller, Raoul Walsh, Anthony Mann. A prodigiously gifted painter himself, he brought to his writing an artist's eye for what was on the screen. Alert to any filmmaker, no matter how marginal or unsung, who was "doing go-for-broke art and not caring what comes of it," he was uncompromising in his contempt for pretension and trendiness, for, as he put it, directors who "pin the viewer to the wall and slug him with wet towels of artiness and significance." <br><br> The excitement of his criticism, however, has less to do with his particular likes and dislikes than with the quality of attention he paid to each film as it unfolds, to the "chains of rapport and intimate knowledge" in its moment-to-moment reality. To transcribe that knowledge he created a prose that, in Robert Polito's words, allows for "oddities, muddles, crises, contradictions, dead ends, multiple alternatives, and divergent vistas." The result is critical essays that are themselves works of art. <br><br> <i>Farber on Film</i> brings together this extraordinary body of work in its entirety for the first time, from his early and previously uncollected weekly reviews for <i>The New Republic</i> and <i>The Nation</i> to his brilliant later essays (some written in collaboration with his wife Patricia Patterson) on Godard, Fassbinder, Herzog, Scorsese, Altman, and others. Featuring an introduction by editor Robert Polito that examines in detail the stages of Farber's career and his enduring significance as writer and thinker, <i>Farber on Film</i> is a landmark volume that will be a classic in American criticism.</p><p>Robert Polito, editor, is a poet, biographer, and critic whose books include <i>Doubles, Hollywood &amp; God, A Reader's Guide to James Merrill's The Changing Light at Sandover</i>, and <i>Savage Art: A Biography of Jim Thompson</i>, for which he received the National Book Critics Circle Award. He directs the Graduate Writing Program at New School University in New York City.*Starred Review* With serious film criticism probably in an inexorable decline due to vanishing venues for publication and the dumbing-down of the moviegoing audience, these writings by the late Farber (1917&#x2013;2008) constitute a pointed reminder of what will be lost. Farber is best known for championing the B movies of such maverick filmmakers as producer Val Lewton and director Sam Fuller, most notably in a signature 1962 essay in which he excoriated moribund white elephant art and praised the termite art made by eager, eccentric artists, art that goes always forward eating its own boundaries. This long-overdue volume amasses all of Farber&#x2019;s cinematic writings, from weekly reviews for the New Republic and the Nation in the 1940s and &#x2019;50s to wider-ranging essays of the &#x2019;60s and &#x2019;70s for such specialized publications as Artforum. Throughout, Farber&#x2019;s iconoclastic viewpoints&#x2014;he panned The Magnificent Ambersons and Casablanca&#x2014;and virtuosic prose provide limitless rewards for readers who can negotiate his unexpected intellectual and stylistic turns. The insight and imagination Farber brings to his subjects, whether a Bugs Bunny cartoon or, in his last published film writing, the uncompromising French masterpiece Jeanne Dielman, is an exemplar for criticism of any sort. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Who Killed Kirov?: The Kremlin&#39;s Greatest Mystery</h2><p>Tackling the mystery of who killed Stalin&#39;s most prized orator, and one of the Soviet Union&#39;s most charismatic leaders, this lively biographical opens Cold War-era Soviet records to lay the matter to rest once and for all.</p><p>In contrast to the brusque, standoffish Stalin, Leningrad party chief and Politburo member Sergei Kirov was charismatic and approachable--a real <i>muzhnik</i>, or man of the people. His rise through the ranks of the communist party to become the prize orator of Stalin's regime was aided by his popularity and his devotion to the cause. The question of who killed Kirov has perplexed Russian bureaucrats and historians alike since the apparent murder took place in December 1934. Although the Stalin regime immediately accused and brutally killed alleged suspects--and then used the murders as a catalyst for massive purges of its enemies--lack of definitive evidence continues to shroud the case in mystery and keeps it rife with speculation to this day. In <i>Who Killed Kirov? The Kremlin's Greatest Mystery</i>, Amy Knight draws on compelling new evidence and presents the most convincing account to date of the Kirov murder and the momentous events surrounding it.<p> In order fully to understand the murder, according to Knight, the reader must learn what kind of man Kirov was, how he rose to power within the Soviet political system, and how Stalin came to dominate that system. Consequently, she devotes much of the book to Kirov's personal story, his role in forging the Bolshevik regime, and his relationships with key party leaders. Although Kirov's murder and its tragic aftermath remain the narrative's focal point, Knight successfully broadens her readers' understanding of the entire Stalinist era.</p><p> A research associate at George Washington University and author of two additional studies of Russian politics, Knight supplements her 270-page study with maps, illustrations, chronologies, a glossary of names, diagrams of the Soviet political hierarchy, and ample notes. Well researched and thoroughly documented, <i>Who Killed Kirov?</i> remains accessible to the general reader. <i>--Bertina Loeffler Sedlack</i></p>On December 4, 1934, the Red Arrow chugged from Leningrad through the freezing dawn to Moscow's October Railway Station. It carried the coffin containing the bullet-scarred body of Sergei Kirov, former Leningrad Party chief, Politburo member, and prize orator of the Stalin regime. Kirov's murder, allegedly by a lone gunman, sparked the brutal purges that characterized the Stalin regime, and speculation about it still fascinates the Russians, much as the assassination of President Kennedy fascinates Americans. <p>Kirov was charismatic and approachable, so popular that many Russians believed he was the only real threat to Stalin's power. Who murdered him, and why? Stalin, disaffected political opponents, a jealous husband? And if Kirov had lived, would the Soviet Union have become a totalitarian police state, or something quite different? Scholars throughout the world see Kirov as the key to understanding Stalin and for years have argued about various pieces of the story-but the necessary evidence has eluded them. Now Amy Knight has combed the recently opened Russian archives to reconstruct this haunting crime and analyze its impact on the Russian people. The result is at once a breathtaking murder mystery and an important piece of scholarship that sheds new light on Stalin's politics.</p></p><h2>A Voyage to Arcturus (Canongate Classic)</h2><p>A seminal work of 20th century science fiction, this extraordinary novel offers a grim yet ironic vision of the nature of the world.

Her articles have been published in a wide variety of business and consumer magazines. She received a master's degree in English literature from New York University. She lives in Massachusetts with her husband and their three children. <i>The Arrivals </i>is her first novel.An empty nest fills back up with alarming speed in Moore's promising debut. Five years have passed since the last of their kids have left home, and Ginny and William Owens have settled into a comfortable rhythm at home in Burlington, Vt., that's unexpectedly disrupted. Their exhausted and defeated daughter, Lillian, shows up with three-year-old Olivia, three-month-old Philip, and without her husband. Within days, Lillian's brother, Stephen, and his pregnant wife, Jane, arrive for an unannounced visit that will turn into a summer-long stay. Daughter Rachel, still working in New York, is teetering on the edge of financial and emotional disaster, and will also end up in Burlington in short order. Moore finds a crisp narrative in the morass of an overpacked household, and she keeps the proceedings moving with an assurance and outlook reminiscent of Laurie Colwin, evoking emotional universals with the simplest of observations, as in "the peace you feel when you are awake in a house where children are sleeping."

So when Thomas Cromwell was led out to his death on July 28, 1540,1 he had the comfort of knowing that he had been granted the privilege of preparing to stand in the presence of the Almighty. The day was sweltering, one in a summer so hot and so dry that no rain fell on the kingdom from spring until the end of September, but the bulky hard-bitten man from Putney who had become the King&#x2019;s most trusted confidant and then his chief minister walked cheerfully towards the scaffold.2 He even called out to members of the crowd and comforted his nervous fellow prisoner Walter, Lord Hungerford, who was condemned to die alongside him for four crimes, all of which carried the death penalty. Lord Hungerford, whose sanity was questionable, had allegedly committed heresy, in appointing as his private chaplain a priest rumored to remain loyal to the Pope; witchcraft, by consorting with various individuals, including one named &#x201c;Mother Roche,&#x201d; to use necromancy to guess the date of the King&#x2019;s death; treason, in that both his chaplain&#x2019;s appointment and the meeting with the witch constituted a crime against the King&#x2019;s majesty; and sodomy, &#x201c;the abominable and detestable vice and sin of buggery,&#x201d; made a capital crime in 1534, in going to bed with two of his male servants, men called William Master and Thomas Smith.3<br> <br>Rumors, fermenting in the baking heat and passed between courtiers, servants, merchants, and diplomats who had nothing to do but sweat and trade in secrets, had already enlarged the scope of Lord Hungerford&#x2019;s crimes. The French ambassador reported back to Paris that the condemned man had also been guilty of sexually assaulting his own daughter. It was whispered that Hungerford had practiced black magic, violating the laws of Holy Church that prohibited sorcery as a link to the Devil. Others heard that Hungerford&#x2019;s true crime had been actively plotting the murder of the King.4 None of those charges were ever mentioned in the indictments leveled against Hungerford at his trial, but the man dying alongside him had perfected this tactic of smearing a victim with a confusing m�lange of moral turpitudes guaranteed to excite prurient speculation and kill a person&#x2019;s reputation before anyone was tempted to raise a voice in his defense.<br> <br>The hill where they now stood had been the site of the finales to some of Cromwell&#x2019;s worst character assassinations. It had been there, four years earlier on another summer&#x2019;s day, that George Boleyn had perished before similarly large crowds after Cromwell arranged a trial that saw him condemned to death on charges of incest and treason. The details of Boleyn&#x2019;s alleged treason had been kept deliberately vague during the trial, while the prosecution&#x2019;s fanciful descriptions of his incestuous seduction of his sister the Queen had been excruciatingly, pornographically vivid. Boleyn, as handsome as Adonis and proud as Icarus, had defended himself so well against the accusations there had been bets that he would be acquitted.5 When he was not, when he was condemned to die alongside four other men two days later, no one could risk speaking out for a man found guilty of committing such a bestial act.<br> <br>Within the Tower&#x2019;s sheltered courtyards, Boleyn&#x2019;s sister Queen Anne was executed in a more private setting, before a carefully vetted crowd of around one thousand, which was tiny in comparison to that allowed to gather beyond the walls to watch her brother perish&#x2014;and now Cromwell and Walter Hungerford.6 Like Thomas More before her, another political heavyweight in whose destruction Cromwell had been intimately involved, Anne Boleyn had embraced the sixteenth century&#x2019;s veneration for the ars moriendi&#x2014;the art of dying.<br> <br>The veil between life and death was made permeable by the teachings of Christianity. Everywhere one looked, there was proof of society&#x2019;s lively fascination with the next life. Death was the great moral battleground between one&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses; the supreme test came when the finite perished and the eternal began. To die well, in a spirit of resignation to the Will of God and without committing a sin against hope by despairing of what was to come next, was a goal endlessly stressed to the faithful in art, sermons, homilies, and manuals. Within the great basilica of Saint-Denis in Paris, the tomb of King Louis XII and Anne of Brittany, his queen, showed the couple rendered perfect in the stonemasons&#x2019; marble, united atop the monument, their bejeweled hands clasped in prayer, their robes and crowns exquisitely carved, but beneath that sculpture the craftsmen had offered a very different portrait of the royal forms&#x2014;there, the bodies of the King and Queen were shown twisting and writhing in the first stages of putrefaction, their feet bare, their hair uncovered, and their flesh pullulating with the onset of corruption.7 Throughout Europe, these cadaver tombs, the transi, were commissioned by the rich and the powerful to show their submission to the final destruction of their flesh and with it the removal of this sinful world&#x2019;s most potent temptations. In corruption they had been born and so through corruption they could be born again.<br> <br>In the sixteenth century, life was precious, truncated at any moment by plague, war, or one of a thousand ailments that would be rendered treatable in the centuries to come, and so the people embraced it with a rare vitality. But living well, as Anne Boleyn had noted at her trial, also meant dying well.8 Christians were supposed to die bravely because of the surety of mercy that even the weakest and most sinful was guaranteed by their religion, provided he or she had respected its doctrines and honored its God. Before they were marched to the hill, Cromwell told Lord Hungerford that &#x201c;though the breakfast which we are going to be sharp, yet, trusting to the mercy of the Lord, we shall have a joyful dinner.&#x201d;9 To the overwhelming number of Henry VIII&#x2019;s subjects, Christianity was not a theory, it was not a belief system, it was not one religion among many&#x2014;it was, more or less, a series of facts, the interpretation of which could be debated, but whose essential truth was inescapable and uncontested. The result of this way of accepting and experiencing their faith was that sixteenth-century Christians often behaved in ways which were paradoxically far more devout but also far more relaxed than their modern-day coreligionists. The line between sinners and the flock was not so clearly delineated, because even the worst members of society were still, in one way or the other, almost certainly believing Christians. All men were weak, all men would fail, all men would die, all men could be saved.<br> <br>To many of their contemporaries, there was an inextricable link between Cromwell&#x2019;s submission to mortality and the ascent in royal favor of the Duke of Norfolk&#x2019;s niece, a view vividly captured by the juxtaposition of Cromwell&#x2019;s death and the King&#x2019;s marriage to the orphaned Catherine Howard on the same day. In the countryside, beyond the stench and sweat of the crowd assembled to watch Cromwell and Hungerford&#x2019;s deaths, Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London, prepared to preside over the King&#x2019;s wedding service. The pretty palace of Oatlands sat in a rolling deer park, its loveliness marred only by the building work that the King, with his passion for architecture, had ordered three years earlier when the manor had come into his possession.10 A fortune was spent on transforming the seldom-used Oatlands into a retreat fit for the sovereign. An octagonal tower, still a work in progress on the day Cromwell was struck down, was added to the courtyard. Terraced gardens were constructed with multiple fountains, each one an enormous extravagance splashing cooling streams of water. An orchard, its mature trees groaning under the weight of fruit, offered shade to the heads of courtiers and servants, as they endured the stifling heat. The orchard was new, but the trees were not. They had been uprooted from Saint Peter&#x2019;s Abbey and brought to grace the King&#x2019;s gardens when the abbey was shut down, its brothers expelled and its possessions stripped by Cromwell&#x2019;s inspectors. The stones that built the little palace&#x2019;s expansion had come from the Augustinian priory at Tandridge as it was pulled down to make way for aristocratic demesnes. The price paid by many of his subjects for the King&#x2019;s religious revolution weighed heavily and silently on Oatlands, but as thick carpets from the Ottoman Empire, chairs upholstered in velvets and cloth of gold, gilt cups, bejeweled table services, and beds hung with cloth of silver were all processed into Oatlands, there was little outward sign of the tribulation that had gone into making it suitable for the royal household.11<br> <br>Edmund Bonner was an Oxford graduate in his early forties. Bonner had risen from relative obscurity, which encouraged accusations that he had been born out of wedlock, to become England&#x2019;s ambassador to France and, after that, Bishop of London.12 He had secured both his ambassadorship and episcopacy through Thomas Cromwell&#x2019;s patronage, yet like everybody else he had abandoned Cromwell in his hour of need. The latter&#x2019;s frantic letters from prison, entreating royal mercy from Henry, written in a disjointed and panicky mess compared to his usual precise calligraphy, had gone unanswered, as all of Cromwell&#x2019;s former dependents turned their faces from him, as if he had never existed.<br> <br>A celebrated person&#x2019;s execution, his final public performance, was such an exciting event that people made the journey into London especially for it. Vast numbers of people surged through the city, converging on Tower Hill to watch the annihilation of the detested commoner who had somehow risen to become Earl of Essex&#x2014;a sign of royal favor given to him only a few weeks before he was arrested at a meeting of the Privy Council and taken to the Tower. The last ascent in the life of the Englishman who had risen farther than anyone else in his century was the wooden steps to the scaffold. Thomas Cromwell had not been a popular figure, but royal advisers seldom are. Snobbery played a large role in shaping his reputation&#x2014;an English diplomat described Cromwell as a man who had been &#x201c;advanced from the dunghill to great honour&#x201d;&#x2014;but so did his actions.13 Ruthless, determined, brilliant, and utterly Machiavellian, Cromwell had overseen the destruction of many an aristocratic career and the evisceration of the old religion in England. Many of his opponents blamed him for tearing asunder the spiritual framework that they had lived, and hoped to die, by. The sacraments and liturgies of the Church had given a rhythm to the year; they had bestowed the tools for salvation on the faithful for centuries, and marked every major moment in a Christian&#x2019;s life. In 1536, Cromwell had weathered a traditionalist uprising&#x2019;s attempts to remove him from power, but he could not survive the loss of the King&#x2019;s favor four years later. His enemies surrounded him, and he was condemned to death on a long list of crimes that included heresy, treason, and financial corruption.<br> <br>The crowds entering the capital on July 28, 1540, came from every background, with well-born women wearing veils to shield their faces from the sun, while urchins wore battered hand-me-down cheap leather shoes which prevented their feet from being cut on the animal bones and refuse that littered the city streets. With no rain, the mud in the streets had become a dry dust that would turn into ankle-depth filth when the clouds broke in autumn. The spectators passed through the capital&#x2019;s eighteen-foot-high defensive walls via one of the seven gates. Those traveling in from the Hampshire countryside entered through Newgate, while those from Smithfield, home to a bustling meat market, accessed the city at Aldersgate. Smithfield also contained London&#x2019;s designated red-light district, the aptly named Cock Lane. Subtlety in the assigning of place names was not a medieval strong point. The southern city of Exeter had renamed one of its rivers Shitbrook, because of the amount of feces and waste it contained, and in Oxford, students hoping for an early sexual experience courtesy of the town&#x2019;s prostitutes could find it on Gropecunt Lane, a narrow alley that ran from just opposite the university church of Saint Mary the Virgin down to the entrance of Oriel College.14<br> <br>Rather more elegant sights awaited those who were traveling towards Cromwell&#x2019;s execution via The Strand, a long straight road lined with the episcopal palaces and impressive homes of the aristocracy. The Strand had been the site of the Savoy Palace, principal residence of Richard II&#x2019;s powerful uncle John of Gaunt, until it was burned down during the Peasants&#x2019; Revolt of 1381. It had eventually been replaced by the Hospital of Saint John the Baptist, one of the most impressive medical establishments in early modern Europe, founded under the patronage of Henry VIII&#x2019;s father. Near the hospital was one of the Eleanor Crosses, funerary monuments erected by a grief-stricken Edward I in 1290 to mark each of the fourteen spots where his wife&#x2019;s coffin rested on its final journey to Westminster Abbey. This, the last put-down before the internment, was now where professional water-sellers traded their wares, taking advantage of the area&#x2019;s excellent plumbing which on occasion pumped the local fountains with wine or beer to celebrate an especially significant royal event&#x2014;the last time had been for the birth of the heir to the throne, Prince Edward, in 1537. On a hot and busy day like this, as families and groups of friends swarmed towards the Tower, the Charing Cross water-sellers could reasonably have expected to turn a handsome profit, but even at this early stage of what turned out to be the hottest summer of the sixteenth century, the Westminster plumbing was struggling to provide the capital&#x2019;s wealthiest region with the water it needed.15<br> <br>There was no sign of similar deprivations at Oatlands, where any eastern- or western-facing windows above the quadrangle provided views either of the orchard with its purloined apple trees, an octagonal dovecote, or ornamental gardens circling the fountains. We cannot say for certain where in Oatlands Catherine Howard resided during her wedding visit. Recent excavations of the palace have given us a better picture of its layout, and the safest guess would be that her rooms were in the Queen&#x2019;s apartments, located in the palace&#x2019;s southern towers between the inner and outer courtyards. From just above the entrance to the inner courtyard, she would have been able to see the ramp that had recently been installed to help her husband-to-be mount what must have been a particularly sturdy steed. Beyond the walls lay the deer park where she and the King would spend a few days of hunting as part of a ten-day honeymoon.<br> <br>Catherine was in her late teens, slender, like most of the Howard women, with a &#x201c;very delightful&#x201d; appearance, according to the French ambassador.16 The court&#x2019;s temporary reduction in size and then its removal to the relative obscurity of Oatlands fueled speculation that she was alre...</p><h2>Rumpole on Trial</h2><p>In this collection of stories, the beloved barrister must fend off the advances of a mysterious young woman, face the Disciplinary Committee of the Bar Council, and take on a group of devil worshippers. Reprint.</p><p>John Mortimer is a playwright, novelist, and former practicing barrister who has written many film scripts as well as stage, radio, and television plays, the Rumpole plays, for which he received the British Academy Writer of the Year Award, and the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.Actor Leo McKern, who played Rumpole on the PBS series, may have died, but the world still has a remarkable interpretation of the Old Bailey defender--in Timothy West's narration. The stories in this volume are familiar from the "Rumpole of the Bailey" TV series, but they're still a treat, not just for the courtroom drama, but also for Rumpole's deft handling of office conflicts. The story line weaves through the seven mysteries, kicking off with a member of the Timson clan falsely accused of devil worship, sending Rumpole into a hostile child welfare court, and ending with Rumpole facing charges of unethical conduct.

John Lennon was one of the greatest songwriters the world has ever known, creator of &#34;Help!&#34;, &#34;Come Together&#34;, &#34;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&#34;, &#34;Strawberry Fields Forever&#34;, &#34;Imagine&#34;, and dozens more</p><p>John Lennon was, as one of the Beatles and the composer of many of their greatest songs, one of the most famous people of the 20th century. He died aged 40 in 1980. Hunter Davies, the editor of the letters, is the author of the only ever authorised biography of the Beatles, as well as the classic The Glory Game. He lives in London NW5.Davies has done an amazing job tracking down nearly 300 of John Lennon&#39;s letters, notes and postcards to fans, friends, lovers, and even his laundry. He has then put each missive in a clear personal and historical context. * Good Book Guide * Nearly 300 are collected and annotated by Beatles biographer Hunter Davies here, and, as most of the originals are reproduced, we can also see the surrealistically silly drawings and graphics he often added in the margins. -- Richie Unterberger * MOJO * I&#39;ve often wondered and shuddered at the prospect of having one&#39;s personal letters, scribble, photos, etc. eventually published for all to see. How embarrassing. But how great that Lennon&#39;s stuff, spanning from childhood to death, have appeared here. * HUFFINGTON POST * Fascinating glimpses into an unguarded mind at work. * RECORD COLLECTOR * The fact that Hunter Davies was asked by The Times to write an obituary for each of The Beatles in 1967, is clear proof that he knows his subject well. In that same year he first met Yoko Ono who has given her blessing to this remarkable project. Davies has done an amazing job tracking down nearly 300 of Lennon&#39;s letters, notes and postcards to fans, friends, lovers, and even his laundry. He has then put each missive in a clear personal and historical context. * GOOD BOOK GUIDE * Lennon&#39;s scribbles tell the story of a boy blessed with genius; his emotional, and cultural and political awakenings are captured in his writings. * WOMAN&#39;S WAY (Ireland) * Hunter Davies, who knew Lennon well and wrote the Beatles&#39; official biography in 1968, has certainly done a superb job of sourcing this material from all over the world. It is beautifully presented, with striking photographs and colour facsimiles of the original texts as well as lengthy annotations. * SUNDAY BUSINESS POST(Ireland) * Individually they don&#39;t tell us a whole lot, but gathered together these missives add hugely to our understanding of what was going on in Lennon&#39;s head * HOT PRESS (Ireland) * Read as a whole, the book follows his path as an exuberant, cocky young Liverpool musician with the world at his feet who experiences an astonishing ascent to global fame. We read his thoughts on his bed-ins for peace, his encounters with the Maharishi, and his love for Yoko, and end up with the multi-millionaire holed up in his Berkshire mansion, then in an apartment in New York&#39;s Dakota, looking after his business interests, lying low, reading books, caring for his second son, Sean, writing when the mood seized him. * SUNDAY HERALD GLASGOW * What is fundamental, however, is the sheer quality of the production, which immediately makes the book a desirable piece of Beatles memorabilia to be treasured. And, once you dismiss the nonsense items, the overall impact remains tremendous, especially the fact that Lennon is thrown off that loner pedestal we thought he inhabited. He is poignantly shown to be a warm, family man, forever concerned about keeping in touch with those he loved as he grappled with significant world issues that troubled him. -- Gerald Isaaman * CAMDEN NEW JOURNAL * More than 200 examples are published (set out in chronological order so the story builds), painstakingly tracked down or borrowed back from those who&#39;d paid handsomely to own them, all full of glorious turns of phrase and, occasionally, in mangled language. * SAGA * It looks beautiful: the cover is &#39;Imagine&#39; - white, the pages carefully designed to weave Hunter Davies&#39;s commentary around both the letters themselves and the transcripts. * THE SPECTATOR * While his public expression is that of a quick-change artiste, the private correspondence is constant. His handwriting is that of an intelligent being. He is often charming, which is maybe surprising. He evinces a generosity of spirit in letters to strangers. He is loyal to his often very odd relations and his ne&#39;er-do-well father. His jocular punning and externally adolescent verbal extravagance are recurrent. -- Jonathan Meades * EVENING STANDARD * Much of Lennon&#39;s correspondence is published here for the first time. Beatlemaniacs will no doubt home in on his sometimes violent exchanges with Paul McCartney in the 1970s, but equally interesting are the more quotidian entries, like grocery lists, homemade Christmas cards and curiously loopy responses to fan mail. * INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE * Long years of research and collection have enabled Davies to compile this revealing archive of notes, doodles, pranks, protests and heartfelt confessions from the Liverpool art-school kid who became an icon of the 20th century. * i NEWSPAPER * The book exudes beauty in an all-white hardbound book. The paper is especially high quality and heavy. The letters are in color, and very well-copied. I highly recommend this book for Lennon fans who want more than surface information; the fan who studies and researches Lennon&#39;s life, and want to understand his history. For those who care to really digest it, they will learn a great deal. -- Shelley Germeaux * IRISH EXAMINER * Though most of the letters are slapdash and artless in themselves, they have a curiously moving cumulative effect when taken as a whole. -- Craig Brown * MAIL ON SUNDAY * Davies was contacted by the band&#39;s manager, Brian Epstein, to write the only authorised pre-Yoko Beatles biography (first published in 1968), so to be entrusted with the keys to the kingdom of Lennon&#39;s correspondence (to which Ono own the copyright) more than 40 years later is a diplomatic coup upon which Kofi Annan might look with envy. -- Ben Thompson * SUNDAY TELEGRAPH * The detective work in sourcing the material was carried out by Beatles biographer Hunter Davies. As Yoko Ono writes in a foreword, he has done well. * BLOOMBERG NEWS * Correspondence with estranged family is especially touching in later years * TIME OUT * A treasure trove -- Pat Kenny * RTE RADIO &#39;TODAY WITH PAT KENNY&#39; * Hunter Davies, the man who wrote the official 1960s biograph of The Beatles, releases The John Lennon Letters today, a collection of nearly 300 quirky letters and postcards sent by Lennon to his family and friends, giving an insight into his life and humour. * EVENING STANDARD * A labour of love -- Simon Mayo * R2 SIMON MAYO * The triumph of these 200 or so letters is that they are not just about John and Mimi, or John and The Beatles, or John and Yoko. they are all of that but, within the framework editor Hunter Davies has given them, they&#39;re about a time and place, and Lennon&#39;s role within it. -- Arifa Akbar * THE INDEPENDENT * I read it from cover to cover and will probably give it as a Christmas present. -- Jarvis Cocker * THE GUARDIAN *</p><h2>EGYPTIAN BOOKSHELF : BOATS</h2><p>Drawing on archaeological and literary evidence, Dilwyn Jones examines the importance of the boat in Egyptian ritual and belief as well as in everyday life. The sun god was thought to travel across the sky in a solar boat, and Egyptians believed that the deserving might join the god Osiris in his divine bark after death. Boats played an important part in funerary ritual; models were often placed in tombs to provide the deceased with safe passage through the &#34;winding waterway&#34; in the underworld. Also, boats are frequently depicted in tomb-painting. The Nile River has always been a vital transport artery for Egypt, and boats the principal means of travel. Early papyrus skiffs gradually gave way to wooden craft of increasing size and sophistication, ranging from fishing boats and barges to seagoing warships, splendid ships of state, and enormous obelisk barges used to transport stone to temples and monuments. Dilwyn Jones traces the development of the different types of boat and the techniques of their construction through the Old, Middle, and New Kingdom periods</p><p></p><h2>Secrets of Dripping Fang, Book Five: The Shluffmuffin Boy Is History</h2><p>After the gang got a little pyromaniacal at the Mandibles' place, nothing's as it should be.

Although the girl&#x2019;s slim body quaked with cold, her thin pajamas and sheets were soaked in sweat. Her skin was so hot, it scalded the fingertips of whoever touched her.<br>&nbsp;The darkened room in the attic of the odd house in the forest smelled like cherry cough syrup, menthol, and stale bedclothes. The sound of her labored, wheezing breathing was hard to listen to.<br>&nbsp;The doctor removed a glass thermometer from between Cheyenne&#x2019;s parched lips and held it close to the bedside light.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;How high is my temperature, Doctor?&#x201d; Cheyenne asked weakly.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;A hundred and six,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;A tortured cough momentarily convulsed her body.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s . . . not so high,&#x201d; she gasped when she could breathe again, &#x201c;is it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said the doctor, &#x201c;not compared to the temperature of boiling water.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Wally, Cheyenne&#x2019;s ten-year-old twin brother, leaned close to Shirley Spydelle&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;Are doctors supposed to be sarcastic?&#x201d; he whispered.<br>&nbsp;Shirley shook her head. &#x201c;No, Wally,&#x201d; she whispered back. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s troll doctors for you&#x2014;no bedside manner. However, they do make house calls.&#x201d; Shirley rubbed four of her eight legs through her silk pajamas and pulled her robe more tightly around herself. Even giant spiders sometimes feel a chill.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey, honey, a hundred and six is nothing,&#x201d; said Vampire Dad, pulling the blankets up over his shivering daughter. &#x201c;I once had a hundred and twenty.&#x201d; This was an outrageous lie to make Cheyenne feel better and she knew it. Dad had never had a temperature higher than a hundred and four, and for the past three years he&#x2019;d had no temperature at all.<br>&nbsp;The troll doctor yanked his stethoscope out of his long floppy ears and zipped up his medical bag. His wart-covered head was so large, it threatened to tip him over on his stubby legs and send him crashing to the floor.<br>&nbsp;Wally, Dad, Shirley, and Shirley&#x2019;s human husband, Edgar, followed the troll as he hopped down three flights of stairs to the front door.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Okay, amigos,&#x201d; said the troll, &#x201c;that&#x2019;ll be two hundred bucks. Cash.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Dad looked at Edgar, then shrugged and raised his palms.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;My word, Doctor,&#x201d; said Edgar in his charming British accent. &#x201c;When we spoke on the phone, I understood you to say one hundred.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said the troll. &#x201c;A hundred for the house call, a hundred for the stairs. Stairs are murder on a troll&#x2019;s legs. If I&#x2019;d known you had stairs, I never would&#x2019;ve come.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Edgar pulled a roll of twenties, as old and limp as cloth, from his wallet. He counted out a sheaf of them and extended it to the troll, who snatched it quick as a toad&#x2019;s tongue.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What is your prognosis, Doctor?&#x201d; asked Edgar. He struck a wooden match with his thumbnail, held the flame close to the bowl of his pipe, and inhaled deeply. It failed to light.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, Professor,&#x201d; said the troll, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a very good chance she&#x2019;ll live through the night, in which case I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if she makes it all the way to lunch tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;And after that?&#x201d; Wally asked.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;After that?&#x201d; said the troll. &#x201c;After that your guess is as good as mine. To be on the safe side, though, I&#x2019;d probably have me a good funeral home standing by.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The troll opened the front door. &#x201c;Heigh-ho,&#x201d; he said, and then hopped through the door and went down the walk, swinging his black bag.<br>&nbsp;Wally, Edgar, Shirley, and Vampire Dad stared out the door after him, paralyzed by his dark news, until Edgar realized that leaving doors open at night in Dripping Fang Forest was unwise, and promptly slammed it shut.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;That guy may be a doctor, but he&#x2019;s a total creep,&#x201d; said Wally. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m sorry, I know you&#x2019;re not supposed to notice trolls&#x2019; heads and legs and warts and stuff, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Wally, the fact that he&#x2019;s a troll has nothing to do with his being a creep,&#x201d; Dad interrupted. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d be just as creepy if he were human. And I refuse to believe that Cheyenne&#x2019;s chances are as bad as he said. A high fever is a good sign. A high fever shows that the body is fighting the infection. Isn&#x2019;t that right, Professor?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; said Edgar, sucking in vain on his unlit pipe. &#x201c;The fever is nothing to worry about. It&#x2019;s the coughing up of blood that I don&#x2019;t like. Now, I&#x2019;m not a doctor, but I do think she&#x2019;s going to be just fine.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;So do I,&#x201d; said Vampire Dad, trying hard not to think about all that luscious blood going to waste. &#x201c;The important thing is to make sure she drinks plenty of liquids. Then she&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll absolutely be fine,&#x201d; said Wally.<br>&nbsp;She&#x2019;s going to die, said Wally silently. My poor twin sister is going to die. Oh, God, please don&#x2019;t let her die. Please, please don&#x2019;t let her die. If you let her live, I&#x2019;ll do anything you want, anything. I&#x2019;ll become a better boy, a better brother. I&#x2019;ll . . . I&#x2019;ll try to be more positive. Cheyenne has always wanted me to be more positive. If she pulls through this, I&#x2019;ll become a total optimist, I swear, even more than Cheyenne. Much more. If you let Cheyenne live, I&#x2019;ll be such an optimist, I&#x2019;ll make her look like me by comparison!<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;She may seem bad now,&#x201d; said Dad, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s always darkest before the dawn. By morning she&#x2019;ll be fever free.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;If it seems certain that she&#x2019;s dying, Dad wondered, can I bite her on the neck just before she utters her last gasp, before her heart contracts that final time and squeezes out her last pulse of nourishing blood, and then have her join me as a member of the living dead? No! I cannot even think such thoughts! I cannot let her die! I don&#x2019;t know if I can believe in a God who let me drown in a Porta Potti and become a vampire, but I&#x2019;m willing to keep an open mind. Okay, God, if you do exist, and if you let her live, I&#x2019;ll do anything you want me to. I&#x2019;ll give up forever my infernal thirst for human blood. I&#x2019;ll get over how hurt I am that she and Wally prefer to have the Spydelles be their parents instead of me. If you let her live, I&#x2019;ll tell them I won&#x2019;t even stand in the way of the Spydelles legally adopting my children.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be fit as a fiddle by morning,&#x201d; said Edgar.<br>&nbsp;What can I promise you, Lord, to convince you to spare this child&#x2019;s life? Edgar prayed. I know&#x2014;if she lives, I shall tell Vampire Dad he no longer has to sleep in the garage at night; he can come back and sleep in the house. Sure, our lives will no longer be safe from his horrid bloodlust, but I&#x2019;m willing to make that sacrifice if you will only let this poor child live.&nbsp;&#x201c;The important thing,&#x201d; said Shirley, &#x201c;is to put ice packs on her and get the fever down. That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s going to do the trick. She&#x2019;ll be fine by morning, you mark my words.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m prepared to do if Cheyenne&#x2019;s life is spared, thought Shirley. If Cheyenne lives, I&#x2019;ll give up my desire to have babies of my own, and I&#x2019;ll insist that the twins return to their real father, bloodsucking demon or not.<br>&nbsp;The phone rang. Shirley picked it up in the living room. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Shirl?&#x201d; said a breathless female voice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Hortense Jolly, at the Jolly Days Orphanage. We&#x2019;re worried sick about poor little Cheyenne. How&#x2019;s she doing? Still alive?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, Hortense, she&#x2019;s still alive,&#x201d; said Shirley, rolling all eight of her eyes. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;The orphans here at Jolly Days and I are holding an all-night candlelight vigil for her,&#x201d; said Hortense. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve written a song especially for the occasion, which they&#x2019;d like to sing her. Is this a good time?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Shirley, &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t be a worse one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Hortense, &#x201c;it&#x2019;ll only take a minute. Could you just hold the receiver up to her ear?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;No, Hortense. Cheyenne is in the attic. There&#x2019;s no phone up there, and I&#x2019;m three flights down in the living room.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, then could you holler up to her to come downstairs and listen to this? I really think she&#x2019;ll get a kick out of it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Cheyenne is running a very high fever,&#x201d; said Shirley with exaggerated slowness. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not having her get out of bed to listen to a song.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Okay, Shirl, whatever,&#x201d; said Hortense. &#x201c;Here comes the song.

This construct is the image of a society in which men separate themselves into three hierarchical orders-those who pray, those who fight, and those who work. Duby explains why this schema, supported by the general movement of the economy and the political and cultural organization, became entrenched in the north of France during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The book begins with a brief examination of a popular early seventh-century treatise on the &#34;three estates&#34; of France. Duby then jumps abruptly back to the period in which the notion that French society was divided into three estates was born. It was the bishops of a tottering Capetian state who drew upon older imaginings of hierarchical order to project a new rationale for royal power and peasant subservience; their ternary scheme collapsed with the monarchy itself, to be resuscitated in the twelfth century, when the maturing of feudal-vassalic institutions and the conflict between Capetians and Plantagenets contributed to a definitive restoration of monarchical trifunctionality. In tracing the fortunes of the three orders, Duby shows how the tripartite schema came to occupy a central position in social thought and clarifies the manner in which feudal society viewed itself.</p><p></p><h2>Journey: An Illustrated History of Travel</h2><p><p>A lavishly illustrated account of human travel with a foreword by <b>Simon Reeve</b>, from the voyages of the Vikings to the flight to the Moon. </p><p>Journeys have arisen from all manner of impulse, from migration and the search for food, to pilgrimages, trade, scientific curiosity, or simply the quest for adventure. <i><b>Journey</b> </i>is a stunning visual guide to the stories of human movement and endeavour, from The Silk Road to the epic Voyager missions. </p><p>Discover ancient maps, biographies of conquerors, explorers, and travellers, stories of scientific discovery and technological innovation, stunning works of art, and catalogues of travel-related memorabilia.</p><p>This truly worldwide account is a glorious celebration of human journeys, and will make an impressive gift for any lover of travel and history.</p></p><p><p>Michael Collins is a native of Ireland and studied theology at the University College Dublin.

Here, Joe Francis Dowden explains in detail how he creates his extraordinary paintings of water, from the stillest pond to the most torrential waterfall. In easy to follow step-by-step demonstrations, he reveals the colors and techniques you need to produce wonderful watercolors. The beautiful paintings of the natural world reproduced here will inspire his admirers to have a go for themselves.</p><p><b>Joe Francis Dowden</b> turned professional in 1982 and has since written many successful books and has been published by David &amp; Charles, Sterling, and now Search Press. He has sold out at numerous "one man" shows and has exhibited his work throughout Britain. He lives in Worthing, East Sussex.May 13 As one might surmise, the medium of watercolor lends itself well to portraying water, but the rendition of realistic-looking rivers, puddles, and ponds is no easy feat. In this short guide, Dowden generously shares with readers his best tricks and techniques for believably depicting water and wetness. After a short introduction, followed by sections on materials, color, and composition, the book offers the reader the chance to try their hand at painting deep, shallow, or lively water through projects with step-by-step instructions. VERDICT Useful for intermediate and advanced landscape artists, but not those wishing to paint oceans, as this is the one body of water Dowden does not address. * Library Journal, USA * Mar 13 Watercolour is a perfect medium for painting water, as it can create some very realistic effects. This is only a small book but it is crammed full of ideas and step by step demonstrations making it an ideal reference book. A variety of techniques are covered including the use of splattering and laying washes. He looks in detail at three of the most common types of water: a deep slow moving river, a fast moving stream and a shallow stretch of still water. The step by step instructions are clear and easy to follow. Yet, as he points out, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to painting water. Each artist has to develop their own unique style and should experiment as much as possible to work out what is right for them. This is a very useful book with lots of ideas and inspiration. * Monstersandcritics.com * Feb 13 Find out how to capture water in this Art Handbook series guide. From still ponds to puddles, brooks and rivers. there are over 80 step by step photos to help you gain confidence in capturing water and improving your skills.

Born in Luxembourg, raised in Wisconsin, and trained as a lithographer's apprentice, Steichen took up photography in his teens and by age twenty-three had created brooding tonalist landscapes and brilliant psychological studies that won the praise of Alfred Stieglitz in New York and Auguste Rodin in Paris, among others. Over the next decade, this young man--the preferred portraitist of the elite of two continents--was repeatedly acclaimed as the peerless master of the painterly photograph. This volume, covering the period from the late 1890s to World War I, highlights masterpieces from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which houses the finest collection of Steichen's early work in the world, and reproduces them in near-facsimile through four-color digital offset lithography.</p><br><p> Steichen worked with a designer's inventive eye, a Symbolist's poetic sensibility, an entrepreneur's charisma, and--above all--the originality and finesse of a creative and painstaking printer to establish ambitious new standards in artistic photography. Overlaying the subtle tone-poetry of his platinum prints with repeated washes of harmonious color, he created unforgettable images. In his three famous twilight views of New York's Flatiron Building, one of the landmarks of turn-of-the-century architecture, Steichen crafted a powerful symbol of a new age. His stunning sequence of Rodin's <i>Balzac</i> figure in the moonlight is presented here as are his nudes, with their frankly erotic sense of flesh and weight. And the intense energy of a decade comes to life in his portraits of a diverse cast ranging from Richard Strauss to J. P. Morgan, Maurice Maeterlinck to George Bernard Shaw--and Steichen himself, the founding auteur of a century of celebrity. In the accompanying text, Joel Smith explores Steichen's maturing artistry in the light of contemporary developments in photography, graphic design, and the decorative arts.</p><br><p> This is a stunning visual record of the emergence of Steichen as a great artist and is one of the most important books to be published on his life and work in recent years.</p></p><p><b>Joel Smith</b> is a former Jane and Morgan Whitney Fellow in the Department of Photographs at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.Text: German</p><h2>Maria Sabina: Her Life and Chants (New Wilderness Poetics) (English, Central American Indian Languages and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Commentary on her poems accompanies a biographical profile of the Mazatec shaman who continues to practice preColumbian rituals</p><p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>Flower Net</h2><p>In the depths of a Beijing winter, during the waning days of Deng Xiaoping's reign, the U.S. ambassador's son is found dead - his body entombed in a frozen lake. Almost simultaneously, American officials find a ship adrift in the storm-churned waters off Southern California. No one is surprised to find the fetid hold crammed with hundreds of undocumented Chinese immigrants - the latest cargo in the Chinese mafia's burgeoning smuggling trade.

Stark heads for Beijing to team up with police detective Liu Hulan, whose unorthodox methods are tolerated only because of her spectacular investigative abilities. Their investigation carries them (and the reader) into virtually every corner of today's China - from its glitzy karaoke bars, where the nation's new elite cuts deals, to the labyrinthine hutongs, where ordinary Beijingers have lived and died for centuries.<br>Stark and Liu's search leads them from the Chinese capital to Los Angeles's thriving Asian community and turns up a bloodthirsty murderer at the very apex of China's power structure. Their work together also ignites their passion for each other - a passion forbidden by their respective governments and one that plays right into the hands of a serial killer.</p><p>"Inspector Liu, do I need to remind you that China has customs and rituals for dealing with guests?" says a top Chinese official to one his police investigators early in Lisa See's tremendously powerful debut thriller. "Remember that all foreigners are potentially dangerous. Don't be tempted to say what you think. Don't show anger or irritation. Be humble and careful and gracious. Draw them in. Let them think they have a connection to you, that they owe you, that they should never cause you any embarrassment. This is how we have treated outsiders for centuries. This is how you will treat this foreigner as long as he is our guest." The fact that the official is her father and the foreigner in question is her former lover, an assistant U.S. attorney named David Stark, makes things much more complicated for Liu Hulan. Hulan is a former Red Princess, one of the privileged children of Chairman Mao's most trusted aides. When two young men (the son of the American ambassador to China and the son of an immensely powerful Chinese businessman with possible criminal connections) are murdered under similar circumstances, Hulan and Stark are cynically manipulated by their respective governments into a joint investigation that exposes the worst of both countries. The situation also gives See a chance to meld her impressive talent for writing fiction with the solid journalism skills that invigorated her family saga <i>On Gold Mountain</i>.In <i>Flower Net,</i> Lisa See gives us a China not often seen: An extraordinary nation that is at once admirable and frightening.<br><br>Here the veil is ripped away from modern China--its venerable culture, its teeming economy, its institutionalized cruelty--and the inextricable link between China's fortunes and America's&nbsp;&nbsp;is underscored.<br><br>In the depths of a Beijing winter, during the waning days of Deng Xiaoping's reign, the U.S. ambassador's son is found dead--his body entombed in a frozen lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost simultaneously, American officials find a ship adrift in the storm-churned waters off Southern California.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is surprised to find the fetid hold crammed with hundreds of undocumented Chinese immigrants--the latest cargo in the Chinese mafia's burgeoning smuggling trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;What <i>does</i> surprise Assistant U.S. Attorney David Stark is his discovery that among the hapless refugees lies the corpse of a Red Prince, a scion of China's political elite.<br><br>The Chinese and American governments suspect that the deaths are connected, and in an unprecedented move they join forces to solve this cross-cultural crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stark heads for Beijing to team up with police detective Liu Hulan, whose unorthodox methods are tolerated only because of her spectacular investigative abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their investigation carries them into virtually every corner of today's China, and leads them to Los Angeles's thriving Asian community--where their search turns up a bloodthirsty murderer at the apex of China's power structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their work together also ignites their passion for each other--a passion forbidden by their respective governments, and one that plays right into the hands of a serial killer.<br>An accomplished stage actress, Elaina Davis performed in <i>Hamlet,</i> and in <i>Richard II</i> and <i>Troilus &amp; Cressida</i> for the New York Shakespeare Festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a principal character on television's <i>As The World Turns,</i> and has appeared in the film <i>Contact.</i></p><h2>The Fourteenth Chronicle: Letters and Diaries of John Dos Passos</h2><p>In the 1960&#39;s John Dos Passos began calling his novel contemporary chronicles, and to his latest piece of fiction he gave the working title The Thirteenth Chronicle.

It came to rest on the TV above the Manhattan restaurant's bar. Because the presidential inauguration was less than a day away, media was replaying the whole "lost ballot" business in excruciating detail: the characters in the Florida GOP implicated in the computer tampering conspiracy, and the Supreme Court decision that had ultimately determined the outcome of the election. The country was sick of hearing about it, and so was she. She just wanted it over with. After all, there were checks and balances built into the system, no matter who was elected. The Republicans had had three successive terms in the White House since 1980. How bad could a Democratic President be?<br><br>The tall, gaunt man on the other side of the table tapped his water goblet with a silver spoon to get her attention. "We were discussing terms on a multibook deal," Noah Prentiss reminded her.<br><br>It took an effort of will on her part not to stare at the swollen red knob of his nose and the constellations of tiny starbursts on his cheeks.<br><br>Prentiss was an alcoholic, low-rung literary agent. His low-rung client&#x2014;a small pudgy man who bit his nails&#x2014;sat to his left. They had turned their half of the white linen tablecloth into a veritable Jackson Pollack of red-wine spills, meat juice and grease spots, bits of discarded gristle, drips of Caesar dressing, shreds of romaine and escaped bread crumbs.<br><br>"Kyle and I have discussed the matter at length," Prentiss went on, "and feel a raise in advance is appropriate on the next Clanker contract."<br><br>Clanker was one of the eight-book series Veronica edited for a New York City paperback house. The central character of the same name was a steampunk cyborg&#x2014;coal and wood fired.<br><br>"No one writes Clanky as good as me," Kyle Arthur Levinson boasted, somewhat thickly after four martinis and a half bottle of cabernet.<br><br>Veronica looked from one man to the other but did not reply. Silence in answer to a question was a negotiating technique she had learned from the five-foot-two pulp-fiction publisher, cigar-smoking entrepreneur and renowned tightwad who was her boss. It was a strategy that put the opposition at an immediate disadvantage.<br><br>If she had chosen to, she could have listed many reasons why Mr. Levinson didn't deserve more book contracts, let alone a raise in pay. He never turned in his assignments on time. Despite the advance outlines to the contrary, he wrote the same story over and over. Clanker aways ran short on energy at a crucial moment in the plot and broke up some chairs or bookshelves to burn in his brass firebox, thus saving the day. Levinson cannibalized action and sex scenes word for word from his own books. He never researched or fact-checked his work. He never read books by the other ghosts in the series, which created conflicts with canon. None of these issues set him apart from the rest of the stable&#x2014;to one degree or another, all the writers were guilty of the same offenses. So why should he get more money?<br><br>Prentiss had an answer for that.<br><br>"Remember," the agent said, "Kyle's been on this series from the start. He helped build its current global audience."<br><br>"I'm the one who invented ol' Clanky's catch phrase, 'Stoke me!'"<br><br>That was hardly something Veronica could forget. Levinson used that tag line at least fifty times in every book, and she had to go through the manuscript and personally remove forty-five of them. Truth be told, "his" catch phrase for Clanker was stolen from "Stalk me!"&#x2014;the catch phrase from another of the company's series, Slaughter Realms. Which in turn had been lifted from "Stake me!"&#x2014;the catch phrase of the house's vampire line, Blood City.<br><br>Sometimes in the middle of an excruciating edit of one of his Clankers, she caught herself wishing he'd write "Choke me!" so she could strangle him with a clear conscience.<br><br>"We have come up with some numbers we'd like to run by you," Prentiss said, holding out a slip of paper.<br><br>Veronica took it and put it in her purse without looking at it. "A decision like this has to come from the top," she said. "I'm sure you understand..."<br><br>"Of course," Prentiss said. "I understand completely. Now, how about a little something sweet?"<br><br>Levinson was already scanning the dessert menu with keen interest.<br><br>Half an hour later Veronica was starting to feel hungry. She'd had only sparkling water to drink, a seafood risotto and an undressed green salad. Not wanting to prolong the ordeal by ordering more food, she paid the tab with a company credit card and left agent and client happily nursing their third brandies. She knew her boss wouldn't grouse about the bill. A $300 lunch was peanuts compared to actually giving Levinson a raise. Effective stalling cost money but paid off big time down the road when the writer became desperate. And sooner or later, writers always became desperate.<br><br>Outside the restaurant, the January temperature was in the high thirties; it felt colder because it was so damp. She thought about walking the five blocks back to the office but changed her mind. She had a big pile of manuscripts to edit at home, and she wanted to get out of her high heels and into a pair of comfy slippers. After hailing a passing taxi and getting in, she gave the driver the address of her apartment in the East Village.<br><br>Her thoughts returned to the Levinson problem.<br><br>That there were always worse writers out there had been pounded into her by painful experience. "Better the bad writer you know" was the company's longstanding philosophy. To overcome the failings of the stable, failings all too apparent to readers of the various series, and to keep her job, she'd had to master the relevant facts and skills herself. She had learned about weapons, tactics, martial arts, survival, engineering, astrophysics; the list went on and on. Despite the fact that she was only twenty-six, she was a mother figure to the writers she herded&#x2014;a dispenser of sustenance, corrector of embarrassing mistakes, protector and defender. They were babies, all of them. Some white-haired or hairless, some toothless with age, but still helpless, whining babies.<br><br>The cab pulled up in front of her brownstone on a street lined wall-to-wall with similar narrow, multistory houses, all of the same, roughly 1850, vintage. Sickly, leafless trees grew out of spike-ringed holes in the sidewalk.<br><br>After paying the cabbie, she climbed the steep front stairs, unlocked the door and stepped into the small foyer. As she started up to her second-floor apartment, she considered blowing off work, putting her feet up and reading a good book for a change. A rumble from the floor above startled her. It sounded like a stampede of elephants. Looking up, she saw huge, dark figures lumbering down from the landing. They were as wide bodied as NFL players. The marble staircase shook under their combined weight. She flattened her back against the wall to keep from being trampled.<br><br>As they poured past, she saw there were eight or nine of them, all dressed in a kind of uniform: royal-purple satin hoodies and black satin jogging pants. She couldn't get a clear look at their faces because of the hoods and because they were moving so fast. She did see and recognize the skeletonized buttstocks of AKS-74U "Krinkovs," some of them slung under the hoodies, the abbreviated autorifles looking like children's toys. In the middle of the pack, apparently being guarded by the others, was a spindly, frail individual.<br><br>Was that Bob Dylan? she thought, turning to look as they crossed the foyer below and trooped out the front door. A rumor had started going around the block that morning that the famous balladeer had bought the brownstone next to this one, but no one had actually seen him yet. What was Bob Dylan doing in <i>her</i> building? The odd smell left in their wake made her wrinkle her nose.<br><br>When she peered over the second-floor landing, her heart sank. Her apartment door was standing wide open. Without thinking, she crossed the hall and rushed inside. The place had been trashed&#x2014;furniture overturned, lamps broken, pictures knocked off the walls as if a whirlwind had struck. The television, stereo and computer were untouched. It smelled like a meth lab.<br><br>"Talu, Petey!" she called. "Lucy!"<br><br>The cats didn't come.<br><br>She found all three hiding, wide-eyed, in a corner under the bed. Much to her relief, they were unhurt.<br><br>Nothing seemed to be missing from the bedroom; everything was just as she had left it. The autographed black-and-white photo of a bearded, smiling Robertson Davies sat atop her dresser.<br><br>Oh crap, the Eagle! She jumped up and tore open her closet door. Behind cartons of neatly packed summer clothes on the top shelf, the lock box was still there. She opened it with the keypad and looked down with relief at the Bengal tiger-striped .44 Magnum Desert Eagle snug in its fitted foam case. It had been a strange gift from an even stranger man&#x2014;restrainingorder strange.<br><br>Robert Marx, in addition to being bipolar and a con man, had authored a few books for the company's Western soft-core-porn line, Ramrod&#x2014;that series' catch phrase was both obvious and literal. Veronica had never dated Marx, never saw him once outside the company offices, but he had become so enamored of her that out of the blue, he'd given her this $2,500, illegal-in-NYC pistol&#x2014;the world's most powerful handgun, in fact. Something Marx thought incredibly funny.<br><br>Primarily to defend herself against him&#x2014;and people like him&#x2014;Veronica had learned at a range in Connecticut to shoot the monstrous thing. She'd initially had serious problems with muzzle control because of the weapon's weight&#x2014;four-and-a-half pounds, fully loaded&#x2014;and its tremendous recoil. To master it, she'd had to strengthen her wrists and forearms with dumbbell finger curls.<br><br>A loud, sudden noise from the living room made her stiffen. It sounded like something heavy had fallen. Maybe one of her floor-to-ceiling bookshelves had crashed to the floor.<br><br>They're back! was her only thought.<br><br>Veronica kicked off her heels. With the ease of much practice&#x2014;and without chipping a nail&#x2014;she slapped home the pistol's loaded magazine and chambered the first fat wadcutter round in the stack. Snatching the custom-molded earplugs from the case, she thumbed them into place as she moved to the bedroom door. When she burst into the living room with the auto-pistol in a two-handed grip, ready to fire, there was no one there. Above the toppled chairs and scattered manuscript pages, a weird gray mist swirled in the air.<br><br>Something terrible was about to happen. She could feel it in the pit of her stomach.<br><br>Firmly planting her feet, she aimed the Eagle at the churning, expanding cloud. As she stared over the iron sights, it occurred to her that she had finally and completely lost her mind.<br><br>Chapter Two The pain didn't stop when Ryan went blind in his one good eye.<br><br>Or when he stopped breathing. Or when his heart stopped beating.<br><br>Consciousness and sensation stubbornly remained while his body stretched and stretched, like a strand of spit, until it was a slithering ribbon a molecule high and a molecule wide. Until it was light years long. The cries of his companions were an unbroken wail, which he vibrated to, like a plucked guitar string.<br><br>It was nothing like the jump nightmares he had experienced before. The random, twisted horror stories peopled by ex-lovers, bloodthirsty muties and archenemies of his past were at least a comprehensible agony, with beginnings, middles and ends. There were no time signposts in this version of hell, nothing to separate one excruciating instant from the next. He was being stretched and stretched, but to where? To what? Had they been tricked into an endless loop of matter transfer, never arriving, forever in transit?<br><br>And the worst part of all: he had hit the button. Ma-gus's victory, their defeat, was by his own hand. His own bastard hand.<br><br>Suddenly the pressure seemed to ease a bit; before he could come to grips with the change, it reversed entirely. Instead of stretching, there was compression. Violent, dramatic compression at both ends, like g-forces trying to crush him flat, to drive the back of his head into the base of his spine, his ankles into his hipbones. Caught between the downward and upward forces, his insides were squashed. He just managed to roll onto his side as he projectile-vomited.<br><br>Choking and gasping for air, Ryan could feel the smooth floor beneath his cheek and temple.<br><br>He opened his eye and could see a dim light in the heart of the swirling fog.<br><br>They had arrived. Somewhere.<br><br>As he crawled toward the brightness, he felt as if he had been run over by a convoy of wags. His skin crackled strangely, as if tissue paper had been stuffed under it. The others were moving on all fours, also apparently unable to stand. He counted the dark shapes on either side of him&#x2014;all were accounted for.<br><br>"Triple red," he said, or tried to say. His voice came out as a hoarse and almost inaudible croak.<br><br>None of them, himself included, had the strength to do more than drag their blasters along.<br><br>The edges of the porthole doorway were obscured by the dense, low-hanging fog. As he advanced hand over hand toward the center of the light, the hard glass turned into something softer under his palms and then his knees.<br><br>The gray mist began to lift from the floor. The door stood open.<br><br>He saw a pair of bare feet in front of him&#x2014;small, pale, female feet, with red-painted toenails. As the fog dissipated, the woman came into full view. She was young and dressed as no Deathlander he'd ever seen&#x2014;not even a baron's wife. Her clothes looked new and were of a strange style: a jacket tailored at the waist and a knee-length skirt snugged around the hips, both cut from the same shiny gray cloth. In her ears, there were sparkling jewel studs, what Ryan thought to be diamonds from pics he had seen. Her shoulder-length hair was brown with red highlights, her small nose freckled.<br><br>But what commanded his attention was the enormous gold handblaster she held pointed at them, hammer cocked back to fire. The hole in the business end looked as big as a sewer pipe. The slide and frame were black striped, like the pelt of a tiger. From her stance he could tell she knew what she was doing, and the yawning muzzle stayed rock steady. Her fingernail color matched that of her toes.<br><br>"This isn't happening," she said, a look of horror in her eyes. Then it passed and she said, "Don't move, any of you!"<br><br>Ryan tried to speak and couldn't make his throat muscles obey. A faint, wheezing noise escaped his lips.<br><br>To his right, Ricky was still retching, but nothing was coming out of his mouth. He had already vomited all down the front of his T-shirt.

Lower brings to the forefront an unexplored aspect of the Holocaust.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Washington Post</i><br><br>In a surprising account that powerfully revises history, Wendy Lower uncovers the role of German women on the Nazi eastern front&#x2014;not only as plunderers and direct witnesses, but as actual killers. Lower, drawing on twenty years of archival research and fieldwork, presents startling evidence that these women were more than &#x201c;desk murderers&#x201d; or comforters of murderous German men: they went on &#x201c;shopping sprees&#x201d; and romantic outings to the Jewish ghettos; they were present at killing-field picnics, not only providing refreshment but also shooting Jews. And Lower uncovers the stories of SS wives with children of their own whose brutality is as chilling as any in history.<br><br><i>Hitler&#x2019;s Furies</i> challenges our deepest beliefs: women can be as brutal as men, and the evidence can be hidden for seventy years.<br><br>&#x201c;Disquieting . . . Earlier books about the Holocaust have offered up poster girls of brutality and atrocity . . .

The long-held picture of German women holding down the home front during the war, as loyal wives and cheerleaders for the F�hrer, pales in comparison to Lower&#x2019;s incisive case for the massive complicity, and worse, of the 500,000 young German women she places, for the first time, directly in the killing fields of the expanding Reich.<br><br><i>Hitler&#x2019;s Furies</i> builds a fascinating and convincing picture of a morally &#x201c;lost generation&#x201d; of young women, born into a defeated, tumultuous post&#x2013;World War I Germany, and then swept up in the nationalistic fervor of the Nazi movement&#x2014;a twisted political awakening that turned to genocide. These young women&#x2014;nurses, teachers, secretaries, wives, and mistresses&#x2014;saw the emerging Nazi empire as a kind of &#x201c;wild east&#x201d; of career and matrimonial opportunity, and yet could not have imagined what they would witness and do there. Lower, drawing on twenty years of archival and field work on the Holocaust, access to post-Soviet documents, and interviews with German witnesses, presents overwhelming evidence that these women were more than &#x201c;desk murderers&#x201d; or comforters of murderous German men: that they went on &#x201c;shopping sprees&#x201d; for Jewish-owned goods and also brutalized Jews in the ghettos of Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus; that they were present at killing-field picnics, not only providing refreshment but also taking their turn at the mass shooting. And Lower uncovers the stories, perhaps most horrific, of SS wives with children of their own, whose female brutality is as chilling as any in history.<br><br><i>Hitler&#x2019;s Furies</i> will challenge our deepest beliefs: genocide is women&#x2019;s business too, and the evidence can be hidden for seventy years.<br></p></p><h2>The Gospel Explained by the Spiritist Doctrine</h2><p>The Gospel ( Explained by the Spiritist Doctrine) is a splendid book - elegantly written, radiant in its prose, and a source of charm for the speculative imagination. The book celebrates Allan Kardec&#39;s discovery of the Christian message through the poetic longings and devotional confessions of those who have already crossed the great river.</p><p>Allan Kardec, the nom de plume of H. Leon Denizard Rivail, was a French educator and philosopher born in Lyon on October 3, 1804. In Iverdon, Switzerland, he studied under the prominent Swiss educator, J. H. Pestalozzi, becoming one of his close collaborators. On returning to France, Rivail founded a school modeled after Pestalozzi's and published works on public education and on the teaching of mathematics and French. For one of his research papers, he was inducted into the Royal Academy of Arras. Rivail spoke several languages, and his impressive intellectual background allowed him to teach courses in comparative psychology, astronomy, chemistry and physics in a prestigious scientific school in Paris. Like his teacher Pestalozzi, he was also a champion of the under privileged and, from 1835 to 1840, organized and taught free classes in his own home. <p>In 1854, at the age of 50, Rivail first heard of the mysterious "rapping" phenomena that had taken America and Europe by storm. Despite his initial skepticism, he was convinced by close friends to attend an experimental meeting where he was able to witness such occurrences first hand. His intellectual curiosity and scientific instincts told him that there had to be a rational explanation for those phenomena. Consequently, he began soon afterwards to conduct investigations of his own. Eventually he was approached by a group of fellow-researchers who asked him to organize a set of fifty notebooks containing transcripts and journals of numerous spirit communications. Using the same logical rigor that he had applied to his work in education and science, Rivail set out to study this material. In the meantime, he supplemented the transcripts with philosophical and scientific questions, which he posed which he posed to different channels (mediums) in different countries. The answers were compared, analyzed, and organized into The Spirits' Book, which was first published in 1857. To keep his new area of research apart from his writings on education, Rivail -- on the advise of spirit-instructors -- adopted the name Allan Kardec, which he was told had been his name in a previous incarnation. In addition to the books he wrote, he founded the Spiritist Society of Paris and La Revue Spirite, a journal he edited until his death in March 31, 1869.</p></p><h2>The Coelura</h2><p>Casting aside her duty as the heir to the Ambassador of her world, Lady Caissa refuses to marry a man she despises and flees into the Forbidden Zone, where she meets a handsome injured man and sets a world-changing series of events in motion.

If it was raining, if it was snowing; if there was a moon, or if there was none. It wasn&#x2019;t new, it hadn&#x2019;t just come up. Last year it had been that way, the year before, the year before that. But it wasn&#x2019;t going to keep on that way much longer: just hello at eight, good-bye at twelve. In a little while, in just a week or two, their date was going to be a permanent one; twenty-four hours a day. In just a little while from now, in June. And boy, they both agreed, June sure was slow in coming around this year. It never seemed to get here.<br><br>Sometimes it seemed they&#x2019;d been waiting all their lives. Well, they had. Literally, no figure of speech. Because they&#x2019;d first met, you see, when she was seven and he was eight. And they&#x2019;d first fallen in love when he was eight and she was seven. Sometimes it does happen that way.<br><br>They would have been married long ago; last June, the June before, the very first June that he was a man and she was a grown-up girl. Why hadn&#x2019;t they? What&#x2019;s the one thing that always interferes, more than any other? Money. First no job at all. Then a job so small it wasn&#x2019;t even big enough for one, let alone for two.<br><br>Then his father died. In October, after one of those wasted Junes had gone by. His father had been a brakeman on the railroad that went by there. A switch had been defective and cost his father his life; and though he hadn&#x2019;t asked for anything, the railroad must have been afraid that he would, and so in order to save themselves money, they hurriedly, almost eagerly, paid him a smaller amount than what they were afraid he was going to ask for later, as soon as it had occurred to him to do so. And thus they came out ahead.<br><br>It was still a vast amount&#x2014;to him, to her. Eight thousand odd, after the lawyer turned it over to him. It had originally been fifteen. But most lawyers, the lawyer told him, would have taken a straight fifty per cent out of it, and he hadn&#x2019;t, so he was quite a considerate lawyer. Anyway, now they could get married the succeeding June, and that was all they cared about. It had to be June, she wanted it June; it wouldn&#x2019;t have been like a marriage at all if it had been May or July. And anything she wanted, he wanted too. And figures above five hundred lost their reality, they weren&#x2019;t used to them. One thousand was as much as eight, and eight was as much as fifteen. It became just theoretical at those heights, even when you were holding the check in your hand.<br><br>And it was all his, all theirs. His mother had died when he was a kid, and there was no one else to share in it. Gee, June took its time about getting here! It seemed to purposely hang back and let all the other months get in ahead of it, before their turns.<br><br>His name was Johnny Marr, and he looked like&#x2014;Johnny Marr. Like his given name sounded. Like any Johnny, anywhere, any time. Even people who had seen him hundreds of times couldn&#x2019;t have described him very clearly, he looked so much like the average, he ran so true to form. She could have, but that was because she had special eyes for him. He was a thousand other young fellows his own age, all over, everywhere. You see them everywhere. You look at them and you don&#x2019;t see them. That is, not to describe afterward. &#x201c;Sort of sandy hair,&#x201d; they might have said. &#x201c;Brown eyes.&#x201d; And then they would have given up, slipped unnoticeably over the line away from strictly physical description. &#x201c;Nice, clean-cut young fellow; never has much to say; can&#x2019;t tell much about him.&#x201d; And then they would have run out of material on that plane too. He would perhaps take his coloring from her, starting in slowly from this June on. He was waiting to be completed, he wasn&#x2019;t meant to stop the way he was.<br><br>Her name was Dorothy, and she was lovely. You couldn&#x2019;t describe her either, but not for the same reason. You can&#x2019;t describe light very easily. You can tell where it is, but not what it is. Light was where she was. There may have been prettier girls, but there have never been lovelier ones. It came from inside and out both; it was a blend. She was everyone&#x2019;s first love, as he looks back later once she is gone and tells himself she must have been. She was the promise made to everyone at the start, that can never quite be carried out afterward, and never is.<br><br>Cynics, seeing her go by, might have said, &#x201c;Why, she&#x2019;s just another pretty girl; they&#x2019;re all about like that.&#x201d; Cynics don&#x2019;t know about these things. The way she walked, the way she talked, the little slow smile she had for him as they drew toward one another upon meeting, or the same smile in reverse, going backward as they parted&#x2014;those things were only for Johnny Marr to see. He had special eyes for her, just as she had for him.<br><br>They had their date always at the same place, outside the drugstore down by the square. There was a little corner of the lighted showcase there that belonged to them&#x2014;that part where, if you stood before it, the powders and the toilet waters were at your back. Not the part where the boxes of chocolates were, tied up in crimson and silver ribbons. Nor yet the part where the scented soaps were, displayed in honeycombed boxes and looking like colored easter eggs. No, only that far end where the powders an the toilet waters were, where there was a shallow little niche, and indentation, formed by a projection of the brick trim between the drugstore and the next shop on. That was their place, right there. The reflectors at the back of the window, striking through the flasks and bottles, made little sunbursts of amber, gold and chartreuse green; acting on the same principle, though quite unintentionally, as the glass jars of colored water it was once customary to display in apothecary windows for just this purpose and no other. That was theirs, that little segment of the window, that little angle of the wall, that little square of the paving in front of the drugstore. How often he had stood there, when it wasn&#x2019;t quite eight yet, eyes oblivious of everything else around him, whistling a snatch of tune upward at the stars. Tapping his foot lightly, not in impatience, but because his foot was singing love songs to the ground.<br><br>That was their meeting place, there by Geety&#x2019;s Drugstore, their starting-off place. No reason; it had just come to be so. Whatever they were going to do&#x2014;a soda, a movie, a dance, or just a walk&#x2014;they did it from there.<br><br>So you have them, now.<br><br>One night, this night, the last night of the month, he was a little late getting there. A minute or two maybe, not more. He came hurrying along, because he didn&#x2019;t want her to stand there waiting for him. He was always there before her, as it was fitting he should be. But she&#x2019;d be there ahead of him tonight, he was almost certain, and that was why he was hurrying so.<br><br>It was a spring-like night, one of the first this year, calendar to the contrary. The sky had hives, it was rashy with stars. And, he remembered afterward, a plane had just finished going by somewhere up there, just about then. He could hear its steady drone lingering on for a minute or two after it was gone, and then that had stilled into silence too. But he didn&#x2019;t look up, he had no eyes for it; he was saving them for her, for when he&#x2019;d get down there to the square and find her standing there outside the drugstore.<br><br>And then when he&#x2019;d finally turned the last corner and was in the square, the people were so thick, he couldn&#x2019;t see her for a minute anyway. They were like bees. It was as though the drugstore had been robbed, or there had been a fire, or something like that. They stood there in clusters, with scarcely a lane of clearance left in their midst. A strange hush hung over all of them. They weren&#x2019;t talking, they were standing there utterly quiet, not saying a word. It wasn&#x2019;t natural for that many people to stand there in such dreadful silence. It was as if they were frozen, stunned by something they had just seen, and unable to recover from it.<br><br>Whatever it was, it was over already. This was the aftereffect.<br><br>He threaded his way through them. He went first to the place where she should have been standing, their place, right up against the lighted window, with the powders and the toilet waters at her back. She wasn&#x2019;t there. There were others standing there, ranged along there, but she wasn&#x2019;t one of them.<br><br>She might have simply strayed off a little way, into the crowd, in the excitement of whatever this was while waiting for him to come. He rose up on his toes and tried to look over the heads of those in front of him. He couldn&#x2019;t see her anywhere. So then he went out into the crowd himself, once more, to try to find her, elbowing them aside, looking this way, looking that.<br><br>Suddenly he came to the curb line, hidden until now by the almost solid phalanx of people standing between him and it. They ended there. The roadway was clear, they were being kept back on all sides from it, in the form of a big hollow square. There was a policeman there to do it, and another man who wasn&#x2019;t a policeman, but who had deputized himself to help him do it.<br><br>There was something lying there in the big hollow square. A rag doll or something equally limp, lying there in the road. A life-sized doll. You could just see the legs and the twisted little body. They had newspapers spread over its head and face, but the newspapers had gotten soaked through with something. Something viscous and dark, like gasoline or . . .<br><br>There were jagged pieces of broken glass lying about here and there, dark bottle glass. The entire neck of the bottle, intact, was resting a few feet away.<br><br>Some of the people were craning their necks to look up at the windows of the houses overlooking the scene. Some were even looking higher, along the cornices of the roofs. Some higher still, toward where the sound of that plane engine had come from before.<br><br>Johnny Marr moved at last. He took a peculiar tottering step down from the banked curb and went out alone into the open space&#x2014;and what it held.<br><br>Instantly the guardian policeman was standing beside him. His hand came down on Johnny Marr&#x2019;s shoulder, to halt him and turn him back.<br><br>Johnny Marr whispered, &#x201c;Turn the newspaper over a little at the top. I&#x2014;I just want to see if I know who it is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The policeman stooped, briefly curled one of the sodden newspapers back by its outermost corner, then let it straighten out again.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, do you?&#x201d; he asked in an undertone. &#x201c;Do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Johnny said sickly. &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He was telling the truth.<br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t what he had been going to marry. He hadn&#x2019;t been going to marry that. The girl he&#x2019;d been going to marry&#x2014;she hadn&#x2019;t looked like that. Nobody&#x2019;d ever looked like that.<br><br>His hat had fallen off. They picked it up and gave it back to him. He didn&#x2019;t seem to know what to do with it, so finally someone put it on his head for him.<br><br>He turned and went away as though he hadn&#x2019;t known her. The crowd gave way, as he bored his way through it, and then reclosed its ranks after he had passed, and he was swallowed up in its midst.<br><br>He regained that meeting place of theirs, by the drugstore window, by the powders and the lotions shining amber and chartreuse, that one little place of theirs, and leaned up against it with a palsied lurch.<br><br>No one looked at him any more, everyone kept looking the other way, out at the roadway.<br><br>Something with red headlights, a chariot from hell, was jockeying around out there, backing into position. Something was being shoved into it. Something that no one had any use for, something that no one loved, something to be thrown away. The rear doors of the chariot from hell slapped shut. The red glare swung around, glancing across the crowd for a minute, staining its lurid crimson, like a misfired rocket on the Fourth of July that fizzles around on the ground instead of going up; then it streaked off into the distance with a dolorous whine.<br><br>He was still there. He didn&#x2019;t know where to go. He didn&#x2019;t have any place to go. In the whole world there was no place to go but this.<br><br>The shock wasn&#x2019;t so bad at first. It was more a numbness than anything else. You couldn&#x2019;t tell. He just stood there quietly, swaying a little at times like a highly volatile weathervane in a breeze that couldn&#x2019;t be felt by others. The showcase behind him and the little projection at the side kept him upright between them. But the harm went in deep. Deep, into places where it could never be gotten out again. Into places that, once they&#x2019;re sick, can never be made sound again. Deep into the mind&#x2014;into the reason.<br><br>Then presently his eyes struck upward, as if the memory of a drone, the winging-away of death, overhead in the sky, had briefly recurred to his foundering senses.</p><h2>The Seven Rites of the Lakota</h2><p>This book introduces some of the core teachings of the seven rites of the Lakota in the words of a Lakota Elder from Eagle Butte, SD.</p><p></p><h2>Toward a Spiritual Psychotherapy: Soul as a Dimension of Experience</h2><p><i>Toward a Spiritual Psychotherapy </i>collects a series of lectures presented by psychologist Hunter Beaumont over a 10-year period.

Although religious women had gained acceptance and authority in seventeenth-century France, the New World was less welcoming. Emily Clark explores the transformations required of the Ursulines as their distinctive female piety collided with slave society, Spanish colonial rule, and Protestant hostility.<br><br>The Ursulines gained prominence in New Orleans through the social services they provided--schooling, an orphanage, and refuge for abused and widowed women--which also allowed them a self-sustaining level of corporate wealth. Clark traces the conflicts the Ursulines encountered through Spanish colonial rule (1767-1803) and after the Louisiana Purchase, as Protestants poured into Louisiana and were dismayed to find a powerful community of self-supporting women and a church congregation dominated by African Americans. The unmarried nuns contravened both the patriarchal order of the slaveholding American South and the Protestant construction of femininity that supported it. By incorporating their story into the history of early America, <i>Masterless Mistresses</i> exposes the limits of the republican model of national unity.<br><br></p><p>"Clark deepens our understanding of life in early New Orleans through this absorbing study of the Ursuline convent, a community of women who had a profound influence on colonial society. Her ability to draw eighteenth-century Louisiana insightfully into the wider examination of gender, class, race, and religion across the Atlantic world makes <i>Masterless Mistresses</i> a remarkable contribution to early American history."--Daniel H. Usner Jr., Vanderbilt University <br>Clark follows the history of the Ursuline nuns of New Orleans through its years as a French colony, then a Spanish one, then as part of the U.S. after the Louisiana Purchase. The French Ursulines gained prominence in New Orleans through the social services they provided, which also allowed them a self-sustaining level of corporate wealth. The unmarried nuns contravened both the patriarchal republican order of the slaveholding American South and the Protestant construction of femininity that supported it. Clark&#39;s analysis joins the French and Spanish colonial history of Louisiana with the English colonial history of the settlers along the Atlantic to create a more complete picture of the whole of early America.</p><h2>Lesbian Art in America: A Contemporary History</h2><p>The first history of lesbian art in the United States, this volume documents works since 1970 within the context of gay culture and political activism. Authoritative and engaging, this is a "from the trenches" story of which women made what, when, and where. Hammond moves from the mainstream art world to alternative venues, weaving a compelling narrative complete with critical and theoretical discourse. Profiles of 18 prominent lesbian artists, from Kate Millett and Joan Snyder to Deborah Kass and Catherine Opie, complete this groundbreaking contribution to contemporary art history.<br></p><p>It is no surprise to see a photograph by Catherine Opie on the front of this handsome and groundbreaking volume on lesbian art. Opie is now represented in most of the best public collections in America, and her inclusion, along with the current rise of Nicole Eisenman, suggests that the market for specifically lesbian imagery (as opposed to erotica, which has always had an audience) has finally widened to include the great art institutions that still set the canon for contemporary art. Although the text of Harmony Hammond's wonderfully rich book is a little too dense for casual consumption, the history she offers--especially of the middle decade represented here, the 1980s, with its porn wars and the emergence of both postmodernism and postfeminism alongside a remarkable boom in the art market--can be found nowhere else, and certainly not in so graceful a form, lavishly illustrated and perceptively annotated. <i>--Regina Marler</i>A member of the first generation of post-Stonewall, gay and lesbian artists, H<b>armony Hammond </b>was a founder of the pioneering feminist gallery A.I.R. in 1972 and a cofounder of <i>Heresies</i> magazine in 1976.

She spent ten years working in the publishing and film industries. Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, Byer lives in Brooklyn. She has been playing pool since 1999.<i>Sweet</i> is a cool, sexy book, as thrilling and precisely complex as a bank shot that stops the cue ball in perfect position behind the eight ball. Heather Byer can certainly play, but much more important for our purposes, the lady can write. -- <i>James McManus, author of <i>Positively Fifth Street</i></i><br><br>In her fascinating memoir, Heather Byer, a former New York film exec and 'nice girl from Ohio,' takes us inside pool halls and the odd sharks who inhabit them. They teach, tease, and challenge her and the reader in this highly entertaining and inspiring journey of one woman's determination to make a passing interest a passion. -- <i>Elisabeth Robinson, author of <i>The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters</i></i><br><br>In her memoir "Sweet: An Eight-Ball Odyssey," Heather Byer conveys [the] sense that pool, with its raw competition and camaraderie, acts as a salve for an often bleak urban existence. ... As she struggles to learn the game, Byer discovers a competitive spirit she didn't know she had; she learns to control her anger and her fear in a tense match; she realizes that she is lonely, sexy, flawed, frightened, more empathetic and trustworthy than she imagined. Her transformation from a painfully bored executive to a mysterious, messy and powerful woman stalking a pool table is irresistible. ... Although the narrator is in her 30s, "Sweet" reads like a tender coming-of-age story, complete with awkward phases and conflicted epiphanies. ... Her compelling narrative poses universal questions: Can the perks of community (encouragement, comfort, connection) co-exist with competition - in the pool room, in a city, in a relationship? (In one poignant exchange, Byer discovers that she won't get a second date with someone she beats at pool.) ... What Byer learns in the intimacy of a pool match is to make a big mess and try something new, even if you never excel. She acknowledges that this is not an easy task. As "an A-student trapped in a C-student's pool game ... can I still love the game and be just an ordinary pool player? Will that be enough?" The sweetest spot in this memoir is Byer's willingness to ask that question and live with the answer. -- <i><i>Los Angeles Times</i></i><br><br>The real pleasure of reading a memoir lies not in the consumption of confessions, but in watching a writer grapple with the reality that shaped him. War, love, addiction: no matter the subject, a good memoirist positions himself as a lens through which we can discern a universal experience. Casanova's memoirs would be nothing more than a pre-Viagra Superman's litany of conquests if his adventures did not telescope the larger tragedy of committing slow suicide in the guise of love. <p>Heather Byer's gutsy "Sweet: An Eight-Ball Odyssey" opens a window onto the dark world of New York's pool halls. One part memoir, one part suspenseful sports writing, "Sweet" follows Byer's quest to master a difficult and misunderstood game. As she negotiates her way among pool sharks and through league matches and barroom romances, she offers a sharp, savvy perspective on desire, ambition and the galling disadvantage of being a woman determined to play a man's game. And win. </p><p>Byer became a pool convert in 1999, when she was in her early 30s. A Midwesterner who ventured to New York to work in the movies or publishing, she found herself overseeing the New York branch of a feature film company, taking lunch meetings in "loud, obnoxious and overpriced" restaurants. Her initial attraction to pool was as an escape from the drama and drudgery of her career, including the tantrums of an overbearing boss, "who arrives explosively with one of his Armani-clad, psychotically ambitious associates ... and wants to flag down the ma"tre d', pronto." </p><p>"Hypnotized" by the quiet, meditative aspects of pool and the excitement of an alternate reality "where a guy who looks at you wrong gets smacked and the smacker gets tossed onto a city sidewalk," Byer found a new home. But it soon became apparent that there would be greater difficulties at hand than the chalking of a 58-inch McDermott cue. Pool is an exacting, precise game, one whose challenges attract a certain type of personality. "I am," Byer writes, "a perfectionist, and another aspect of pool's appeal is the players' constant strive for perfection. There really is such a thing as a perfect shot in pool, and that shot's success is determined, achingly, by mere millimeters. For a perfectionist, the game is sublime torture." </p><p>Also sublime and tortured are her teammates. The members of Byer's pool league are the highlight of the book. The female players "drink real beer (never lite), shrug off their pool losses like old bathrobes, wear leather jackets and thin scarves when it's 10 degrees outside and never seem to get cold"; they "wear dark lipstick, listen gamely to the boyfriends who worship them - tough, beautiful women who inspire me all the time, whether I'm looking at them through the lens of brainy-girl romanticism or not." And the men aren't half bad either. </p><p>Somewhat less engaging are the passages in which Byer seems to feel obligated to examine her attraction to the game. A comparison between pool and baseball is forced, as are her ruminations on why she was drawn to pool in the first place. After all the exhilarating scenes documenting her growing skill, the reader wonders why she needs to convince herself that such a remarkable game is worth playing. It's obvious. </p><p>Perhaps the most agonizing aspect of Byer's experience was the sexism she encountered. Aside from the perception, voiced by a teammate, that "most women pool players are either ugly or lesbians," there is the institutionalized bias of the players' rankings: "Each player is ranked between 2 and 7; a 2 is the lowest - and usually greenest - rank, and a 7 is a tournament-level player. ... In pool's typically sexist fashion, a woman always starts as a 3 when she first joins the league and a man always starts as a 4." </p><p>Dauntless, Byer rises above all this, no small feat considering the similar handicaps she faced at her day job. Like most talented women, she understands that to succeed at a man's game she must play by his rules, only better and in flashy shoes. The qualities that made her a success at her job account for her triumphs at the pool table: she loves the game enough to keep playing, despite the maddening setbacks. </p><p>Byer's good humor and perseverance brought to mind one of the most satisfying moments from the time when I played pool in bars - the evening my sister, third-trimester pregnant and the captain of her league team, crushed my boyfriend at eight ball. He was so humiliated he sat at the bar for the rest of the night getting wasted on Jack Daniel's. My sister shrugged, chalked her cue and went on to the next challenger. She beat him too. Watching a tough, smart woman hone her game is thrilling; and when Byer sends an opponent packing, one can't help feeling that her hard-fought victory is truly sweet. -- <i><i>New York Times</i>, March 4, 2007</i><br><br>This take on the world of organized pool couldn't be more vivid. You may learn one or two pool tricks reading <i>Sweet</i>, but even better, you'll get to know Heather Byer. Heather's the book, and a lot more fun than shooting pool. -- <i>Elmore Leonard, author of <i>The Hot Kid</i> and <i>Get Shorty</i></i></p></p><h2>Queer: The Ultimate LGBT Guide for Teens</h2><p><p>Honest and engaging, <em>Queer</em> takes LGBT teens on an awesome and enlightening journey through the sometimes scary, sometimes silly, and always fabulous world of queer life.

As if that weren&#x2019;t enough, some of you have one<br>more thing to deal with&#x2014;the possibility (or reality) of being queer. This realization is<br>definitely not a bad thing&#x2014;but it can throw you for a loop.</p> <p>To best grasp what may be going on, you&#x2019;re going to have to spend some time looking<br>within. That doesn&#x2019;t mean staring at your belly button, pondering the cosmos, the<br>existence of God, and what Lady GaGa&#x2019;s going to wear next&#x2014;though if any of that is<br>helpful, go for it. But you will need to do a little soul searching.</p> <p>Lots of teens&#x2014;straight or queer&#x2014;have questions about their sexuality. It doesn&#x2019;t<br>always feel clear cut from the jump. Have you ever asked yourself any of the<br>questions below?</p> <p><br>�&nbsp;I am a girl and I have a boyfriend. But I fantasize about kissing my best<br>girlfriend. Does that make me bisexual?</p> <p>�&nbsp;I think anyone can be sexy, regardless of gender. What does that make me?</p> <p>�&nbsp;I am a girl and sometimes I feel more like a guy. Does that mean I&#x2019;m<br>transgender?</p> <p>�&nbsp;I am a guy and I keep having dreams about my girlfriend&#x2019;s brother.<br>Am I gay?</p> <p><br>If so, you probably want answers. Well, here&#x2019;s the good news: You don&#x2019;t need an<br>answer to this today. Here&#x2019;s the even better news: Whatever the answer is, it&#x2019;s<br>completely fine. Being straight or queer doesn&#x2019;t define who you are as a person. It<br>doesn&#x2019;t say whether you&#x2019;re a good friend or a complete jerk or whether you should<br>do ballet or go out for varsity football. It&#x2019;s just about who you are attracted to and, in<br>the case of transgender people, what gender you want to live as. Any answer is the<br>right one. And it&#x2019;s also OK if that answer changes at some point. It&#x2019;s all good.</p> <p><br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE QUEER?</p> <p>To identify as queer means to see yourself as being part of the LGBT<br>community. That means you consider yourself to be lesbian, gay, bisexual,<br>or transgender. Here&#x2019;s the breakdown.</p> <p>Lesbian</p> <p>Lesbians are women who are emotionally and sexually attracted to other<br>women. The Greek poet Sappho, who lived during the sixth and seventh<br>centuries, wrote about loving other women. She was born on the island of<br>Lesbos, and this is where the term lesbian comes from.</p> <p>There is no &#x201c;typical&#x201d; lesbian. Some lesbians consider themselves to be<br>butch lesbians (also known as studs), which means they express<br>themselves in what society might consider a masculine manner. Butch<br>lesbians might feel more comfortable dressing in men&#x2019;s clothing, playing<br>aggressive sports, working a traditionally manly job, or being the person<br>who is more chivalrous in a relationship. Femmes (also known as lipstick<br>lesbians), on the other hand, usually dress in a more feminine manner, wear<br>make-up, have long hair, and enjoy activities more associated with girly-<br>girls, like maybe shopping or watching chick flicks.</p> <p>Of course, not all femmes wear lipstick, and not all butches work in<br>construction. And some lesbians call themselves futch, a combination of<br>femme and butch. There are also blue jean femmes (a femme who doesn&#x2019;t<br>wear dresses) and soft butches (those who consider themselves a less hard-<br>core form of butch). Boi is another term, which can indicate a hip, youthful<br>butch who may or may not identify as trans. But remember that all of these<br>are just labels that help lesbians clarify their social identity, and the<br>definitions are changing even as we write this book. Not everyone uses<br>these terms, and some people find that their relationships to masculinity<br>and femininity change over the years. If none of these labels feel<br>appropriate for you, feel free to make up one of your own&#x2014;or go without a<br>label altogether. These identities are really about celebrating yourself and<br>your queerness, not bogging you down.</p> <p><br>Gay</p> <p>Gay men are men who are emotionally and sexually attracted to other<br>men. (The word gay is also used sometimes to mean homosexual in<br>general.) Back in the day, the word gay meant &#x201c;happy&#x201d; or &#x201c;carefree&#x201d; and<br>also the more negative &#x201c;licentious,&#x201d; which means &#x201c;lacking moral and<br>sexual restraints.&#x201d; Gay began being used to describe homosexual people<br>in the middle of the last century, though it&#x2019;s not totally clear why. (Maybe<br>people thought gay people were happy to supposedly have no moral<br>restraints!) Today, gay is usually used to describe homosexual men.</p> <p>It can seem like there are as many kinds of gay men as there are kinds of<br>music. Gay men who are into alternative rock and punk, underground art,<br>&nbsp;and hipster fashion call themselves alternaqueers. (Lesbians and trans<br>people can be alternaqueers, too.) Many large, hairy gay men refer to<br>themselves as bears. Some younger men who pride themselves on being<br>thin and clean shaven call themselves twinks. Gay men with feminine<br>qualities might consider themselves queens, and when those qualities are<br>really exaggerated, they might be called flaming. Gay men who work out a<br>lot are often referred to as muscle queens or gym queens and, if they fly<br>around the country to dance all night to circuit techno music, circuit queens.<br>Wealthy gays who often dress in preppy styles are sometimes known as<br>A-gays, and gay men into leather are leathermen. Though you&#x2019;ll find<br>evidence of a lot of these subcultures online and in most major cities, you<br>don&#x2019;t have to belong to any of them, and you could also create your own.<br>Remember, these identities are only to help gay men say a little about who<br>they are to the world. Never take on an identity if you don&#x2019;t want to, or let<br>others label you against your will.</p> <p>Bisexual</p> <p>People who can be attracted to either sex are bisexual. Sometimes people<br>think bisexuals are equally attracted to both sexes, but this is not<br>necessarily the case. If you&#x2019;re open to dating both men and women, even if<br>you prefer one sex over the other, then you can identify as bisexual (or bi).<br>Sometimes people identify as bisexual during a transitional stage before<br>coming out as lesbian or gay. For others, it truly is an identity that sticks<br>with them their whole lives. For some people, coming out as bi is easier<br>because it offers hope to their homophobic parents and friends that they&#x2019;ll<br>end up with an opposite-sex partner some day. For others, coming out as<br>bi is harder because people might want them to &#x201c;choose&#x201d; one sex or the<br>other. If you think you may be bisexual, know that bisexuality has been<br>around forever. Some cultures, like ancient Greece, celebrated bisexuality<br>as a great way of life.</p> <p>Pansexual</p> <p>A little different than bisexuals, pansexuals people are attracted to not only<br>boys and girls, but people who identify as transgender.&nbsp;</p> <p><br>Transgender</p> <p>People who feel there is a difference between their birth gender and the<br>gender they truly are inside consider themselves transgender or simply<br>trans. They often choose to live life as the gender they feel they are, or, in<br>some cases, they don&#x2019;t identify as any gender at all. Transgender people<br>sometimes opt for medical treatment&#x2014;like hormones and surgery&#x2014;to<br>actually change their sex so that their bodies appear on the outside more<br>like what they feel on the inside. People who undergo these medical<br>procedures sometimes think of themselves as transsexuals, though often<br>they prefer to be thought of and referred to simply as the gender they are<br>living as (male or female) since transsexual is sometimes seen as an<br>impersonal medical term. There are also abbreviations for people who<br>change their sex, like FTM (female to male) or MTF (male to female), which<br>are sometimes used.</p> <p>People who feel they don&#x2019;t fit into either gender may use the terms gender<br>queer or gender fluid to describe themselves. They may feel that they are<br>neither male nor female, both male and female, or somewhere in between.<br>They may also feel that even saying there are only two genders is too<br>restrictive, and may identify with one of the various genderqueer terms out<br>there like transboi, bi-gendered, or third gendered.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s important to understand that while the identities of lesbian, gay, and<br>bisexual refer to one&#x2019;s sexual orientation, being transgender does not. It is<br>specifically about gender. People who are transgender can be straight,<br>gay, lesbian, or bisexual.</p> <p><br>Queer</p> <p>Queer can describe people who are any of the above or people who don&#x2019;t<br>want to use any of the these labels but know they fall somewhere along the<br>LGBT spectrum or that they don&#x2019;t fit into the heterosexual norms.</p> <p>If you find yourself wondering if any of the terms in this chapter describe<br>you, you might be queer. Of course, you might also just be questioning&#x2014;<br>and that&#x2019;s OK, too. These days, we often see the acronym LGBT with a &#x201c;Q&#x201d;<br>at the end (LGBTQ). That &#x201c;Q&#x201d; stands for questioning, which means people<br>who are still figuring it out. (And aren&#x2019;t we all just trying to figure something<br>out?) The &#x201c;Q&#x201d; can also stand for queer. Sometimes people even write the<br>LGBT acronym as LGBTQQ or LGBTQQI, where the I stands for intersex<br>(see page 24). With all those letters to keep track of, sometimes it&#x2019;s easier<br>to just say queer!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><br>HOW DO I KNOW IF I&#x2019;M QUEER?</p> <p>You may have simply always felt different from other kids. Maybe the<br>words other people use to describe themselves just don&#x2019;t seem to fit you,<br>or you don&#x2019;t feel comfortable dressing or acting the way that society says<br>you should. If you&#x2019;re a boy, maybe you&#x2019;re into &#x201c;girl stuff.&#x201d; If you&#x2019;re a girl,<br>maybe you&#x2019;re into &#x201c;boy stuff.&#x201d; Maybe you don&#x2019;t feel like you&#x2019;re a girl or a<br>boy but that you&#x2019;re something unique that doesn&#x2019;t really have a name.<br>Maybe you&#x2019;re a boy into boy stuff or a girl into girl stuff, but you feel<br>attracted to other boys or other girls.</p> <p>Even if you relate to any of the above, that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean you<br>are LGBT. Plenty of straight people are into things that most of society<br>doesn&#x2019;t consider &#x201c;normal&#x201d; like heavy metal, contemporary art, or<br>raspberry granola, and you certainly wouldn&#x2019;t base your sexuality on what<br>you like to eat for breakfast. Besides, you&#x2019;re in a stage of your life right<br>now when love can feel a bit confusing, and you may not know if you want<br>to kiss that cute soccer player or just want to be her. You&#x2019;ll probably get<br>crushes on all kinds of people, from teachers and best friends to<br>celebrities and star athletes. You may even go through a period of trying<br>out different things to find out what&#x2019;s right for you. Some days you might<br>feel one way, and other days, another. Just because your friends aren&#x2019;t<br>talking about conflicting feelings around sexuality doesn&#x2019;t mean they<br>aren&#x2019;t feeling them, too.</p> <p><br>That being said, if your feelings persist, then you may decide to start<br>identifying as queer or as any of the related identities. If so, embrace it!<br>Being part of the LGBT community is great, but it does mean that, yes, you<br>are a little bit different than most of the people you know. Being different,<br>of course, is something to celebrate. But it also means that sometimes you<br>might feel like you are from another planet. If so, think of us as your tour<br>guides to Planet Queer!</p> <p>DO I HAVE TO HAVE SEX TO KNOW?</p> <p>Lots of questioning teens think they need to have sex to know if they are<br>queer, and often older people will doubt a teen&#x2019;s assertion of being queer<br>with a response like, &#x201c;How could you know? You haven&#x2019;t had sex yet!&#x201d; But<br>the truth is that you don&#x2019;t have to have sex to know if you&#x2019;re LGBT. Most of<br>the time, it&#x2019;s something you&#x2019;ll just have a sense about. For instance, if<br>you&#x2019;re a guy and you consistently have crushes on other guys, then you<br>might be gay. You don&#x2019;t have to act on those attractions sexually to know<br>how you feel. Straight kids have crushes all the time and they don&#x2019;t need to<br>act on them to know they are straight. It&#x2019;s no different for queer kids.</p> <p>Some people do say that they discovered they were lesbian, gay, or<br>bisexual after experimenting sexually. So that is possible. But most people<br>say that if you are queer, you&#x2019;ll know it on a much deeper level. It becomes<br>a part of your identity and how you see yourself. It&#x2019;s more about who you<br>are and who you have feelings toward rather than simply who you&#x2019;re<br>getting busy with.</p> <p>On the flip side, just because you&#x2019;ve had sex with someone of the same<br>gender, you&#x2019;re not necessarily gay or lesbian. Sometimes people<br>experiment just for fun and still don&#x2019;t consider themselves queer because<br>they don&#x2019;t want to actually date or have relationships with people of the<br>same gender. Or you might have fantasies or dreams about having sex with<br>someone of the same gender, but in real life you don&#x2019;t feel the same way.<br>Obviously, sex is part of the queer equation, but it&#x2019;s definitely not the whole<br>thing.</p> <p>WHY ARE PEOPLE QUEER?</p> <p>That&#x2019;s the multimillion dollar question. And it&#x2019;s one that no one&#x2019;s really<br>been able to answer yet, probably because everyone, queer or straight, is<br>different. For years, scientists have been trying to discover if there is a<br>&#x201c;gay gene&#x201d; or something in our brains that makes us prefer the same sex.<br>So far, the studies have been inconclusive, and we don&#x2019;t know exactly what<br>makes one person gay and another bisexual or trans or even straight, for<br>that matter. There are any number of things that make you the person you<br>are.</p> <p>For some queer people, it seems like they were just born that way. For<br>others, it&#x2019;s the way our emotions and sexuality developed as we grew up<br>and our personality began expressing itself. And other people say that<br>somewhere along the way, they just changed and suddenly started liking<br>people of the same gender.</p> <p>But though you may come into your queerness at any stage, it&#x2019;s not a<br>choice. It&#x2019;s something that naturally happens. You can&#x2019;t &#x201c;train&#x201d; yourself to<br>be straight any more than you can train yourself to have three eyeballs, fly<br>like a bird, breathe underwater, or like listening to the Rolling Stones as<br>much as your parents do. You have no control over your sexual orientation<br>or gender identity. Be authentic and you&#x2019;ll gain the respect of others and<br>yourself. You&#x2019;ll also be way happier in the long run.</p> <p><br>WHERE ARE YOU ON THE SEXUAL SPECTRUM?</p> <p>Back in the 1940s, a sex researcher named Alfred Kinsey asked people to<br>be honest about their sexual activities, fantasies, and romantic attractions.<br>After thousands of interviews, he found that it is rare that a person is solely<br>homosexual or heterosexual. People&#x2019;s desires and preferences fell all<br>along what he called a &#x201c;sexual spectrum&#x201d; (also known as the Kinsey Scale)<br>between gay and straight. What he interpreted this to mean was that most<br>humans have the capability to be attracted to or to fall in love with both<br>men and women.

She lives in Churchville, Maryland.</p><h2>Mae Chee Kaew - Her Journey To Spiritual Awakening &amp; Enlightenment</h2><p>Mae Chee Kaew (1901-1991) was a countrywoman, who lived a simple village life in the northeastern region of Thailand and overcame enormous difficulties in her attempt to leave home and follow the Buddha&#39;s noble path. Blessed with the good fortune to meet the most renowned meditation masters of her era, Mae Chee Kaew took their teachings on meditation to heart, diligently cultivating a mind of clear and spontaneous awareness. Her persistence, courage, and intuitive wisdom enabled her to transcend conventional boundaries - both those imposed upon her by the world and those limited her mind from within - and thereby find release from birth, aging, sickness and death. Mae Chee Kaew is one of the few known female arahants of the modern era and testimony to all beings that regardless of race, gender or class, the Buddha&#39;s goal of supreme enlightenment is still possible.</p><p></p><h2>Blanda, alive and kicking;: The exclusive, authorized biography</h2><p>Book by Twombly, Wells</p><p></p><h2>Misty of Chincoteague</h2><p>Paul and his sister Maureen&#39;s determination to own a pony from the herd on Chincoteague Island, Virginia, is greatly increased when the Phantom and her colt are among the ponies rounded up for the yearly auction.</p><p>On an island off the coasts of Virginia and Maryland lives a centuries-old band of wild ponies. Among them is the most mysterious of all, Phantom, a rarely seen mare that eludes all efforts to capture her--that is, until a young boy and girl lay eyes on her and determine that they can't live without her. The frenzied roundup that follows on the next "Pony Penning Day" does indeed bring Phantom into their lives, in a way they never would have suspected. Phantom would forever be a creature of the wild. But her gentle, loyal colt Misty is another story altogether. <p> Marguerite Henry's Newbery Honor Book has captivated generations of boys and girls both with its thrilling descriptions of true incidents from the tiny island of Chincoteague, and its realistic yet wonderfully magical atmosphere. This story of an animal brought into captivity poignantly reveals the powerful opposing forces of humans and nature. Wesley Dennis's pen-and-ink ponies are masterfully depicted with rippling muscles, shaggy coats, and free spirits. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Nobody could capture the Phantom. She was the wildest mare on Assateague Island. They said she was like the wind, that the white "map" on her shoulders was her mark of freedom. <p> Paul and Maureen Beebe had their hearts set on owning her. They were itching to buy and tame her; and worked hard to earn the money she would cost. But the roundup men had tried to capture her and for two years she had escaped them.... </p><p> Pony Penning Day holds a surprise for everyone, for Paul not only brings in the Phantom, but her newborn colt as well. Can Paul and Maureen possibly earn enough to buy them both?</p></p><h2>The Women Who Raised Me: A Memoir</h2><p><p> Born as a ward of the state of Maine, the child of an unmarried Yankee blueblood mother and an unknown black father, Victoria Rowell beat the odds. <i>The Women Who Raised Me</i> is the remarkable story of her rise out of the foster care system to attain the American Dream&#x2014;and of the unlikely series of women who lifted, motivated, and inspired her along the way. </p> <p> From Agatha Armstead&#x2014;a black Bostonian who was Victoria's longest-term foster mother and first noticed her spark of creativity and talent&#x2014;to Esther Brooks, a Paris-trained prima ballerina who would become her first mentor at the Cambridge School of Ballet&#x2014;<i>The Women Who Raised Me</i> is a loving, vivid portrait of all the women who would help Victoria transition out of foster care and into New York City's wild worlds of ballet, acting, and adulthood. Though Victoria would go on to become an accomplished television and film star, she still carried the burden of loneliness and anxiety, particularly common to those "orphans of the living" who are never adopted. Vividly recalled and candidly told, her story is transfixing, redemptive, heartbreaking, and, ultimately, inspiring. </p></p><p><p>At age eight, Victoria Rowell won a Ford Foundation grant to study ballet and later went on to train and dance professionally under the auspices of the American Ballet Theatre, Twyla Tharp Workshop, and the Juilliard School before becoming an actress. She is the founder of the Rowell Foster Children Positive Plan, which provides scholarships in the arts and education to foster youth, and serves as national spokesperson for the Annie E. Casey Foundation/Casey Family Services. Rowell is an award-winning actress and veteran of many acclaimed feature films and several television series, including eight seasons on <em>Diagnosis Murder</em>, and has starred for the past thirteen years as Drucilla Winters on CBS's #1 daytime drama <em>The Young and the Restless</em>.</p></p><h2>Ideas That Matter: The Concepts That Shape the 21st Century</h2><p>Ideas can, and do, change the world. Just as Marxism, existentialism, and feminism shaped the last century, so fundamentalism, globalization, and bioethics are transforming our world now. In Ideas that Matter, renowned philosopher A.C. Grayling provides a personal dictionary of the ideas that will shape our world in the decades to come. With customary wit, fire, and erudition, Grayling ranges across the gamut of essential theories, movements, and philosophies&#x2014;from animal rights to neurophilosophy to war crimes&#x2014;provoking and elucidating throughout.Ideas are the cogs that drive history, and in explaining the most complex and influential ones in laymen&#x20ac;&#x2122;s terms, Ideas that Matter will help every engaged citizen better understand it.</p><p><b>A.C. Grayling</b> is Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London, and a Supernumerary Fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford.

He lives in London.<b>Simon May, <i>Literary Review (UK)</i></b><br> &#x201c;A work of great scope, erudition and spirit.... it is informed by humanity, hope (not the same, of course, as optimism), a passion for reason and justice, and encyclopedic learning: in short the spirit of the Enlightenment. Its very range (Cloning to Creationism, Quantum Mechanics to Religion, Logic to String Theory) reflects the conviction that only through knowledge, investigation and thought &#x2013; using one&#x2019;s own understanding and pursued without coercion &#x2013; can human beings fulfill their individual potential.&#x201d;<br><p><b>Iain Finlayson, <i>The Times (UK)</i></b><br> &#x201c;If there is any such person in Britain today as The Thinking Man, it is AC Grayling, Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck. He provides generous help for the ethically challenged, the philosophically perplexed and the culturally confused. There are any number of ideas in the modern world; they are like trees in a forest... Clearly and succinctly, without jargon or condescension, Grayling takes on the intellectual world and names its parts. He does us great service with this useful handbook."<br><br></p><br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> &#x201c;Grayling winnows a universe of ideas, ideologies, and philosophies into &#x2018;a personal dictionary&#x2019; for understanding the new century....

Even readers with different points of view...will benefit from Grayling&#x2019;s clear accounts of his topics. He is especially good at explaining clearly difficult ideas, e.g., the standard model of physics; the entries on philosophical topics are particularly well done. All readers interested in the issues discussed &#x2013; and who isn&#x2019;t? &#x2013; will gain much from this book.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Kirkus</i></b><br> &#x201c;As always, Grayling delights in a bit of polemic while expressing himself with the crispest of prose; his sharpest jabs are reserved for the irrational aspects of religion. But, like most of his books, this account is designed to be more thought-provoking than utterly authoritative. It succeeds.&#x201d;<br><br></p><h2>Surviving a Shark Attack (On Land): Overcoming Betrayal and Dealing with Revenge</h2><p>Filled with her trademark no-nonsense voice, and building on the principles developed during her long career as a licensed therapist, Dr. Laura Schlessinger shows readers how to survive enemies&#x2014;traitors, backstabbers, and saboteurs&#x2014;at work and at home.

There's one flavorful piece, "Bad Boys in Tinseltown," about the day in 1967 when Ellroy--then a speed freak who broke into fancy houses to steal stuff and sniff women's underwear--read an article by Curtis Hanson raving about <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> and was inspired. Then Ellroy flashes forward to 1996, when he visits Hanson as he directs the triumphant film version of <i>L.A. Confidential</i>. </p><p> <i>GQ</i> talked Ellroy into writing about the event that made him a maniac, and then an obsessive writer: his dissolute mother's unsolved murder in 1958, when he was 10. His investigation of her death began with the chilling <i>GQ</i> article "My Mother's Killer," which grew into the book <i>My Dark Places</i>. (If you haven't heard Ellroy read it on audiotape, you haven't shivered.) His investigation of another woman's murder, "Body Dumps," is in some ways better, because there's a suspect to eviscerate in prose. "Sex, Glitz, and Greed," written about O.J. during the trial, is an odd fit in this collection, but when Ellroy is on his own turf--L.A.'s seamy, undead past--nobody can touch him. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"One of the best Amercan writers of our time." --<b>Los Angeles Times</b><p>"A blood poet who writes as chain saws crank, Ellroy has vigorously redefined the well-shadowed turf of contemporary crime fiction." --<b>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</b></p><p>"Nobody in this generation matches the breadth and depth of James Ellroy's way with noir." --<b>The Detroit News</b></p><p>"His spare noir style . . . hits like a cleaver but . . . is honed like a scalpel." --<b>Chicago Tribune</b></p></p><h2>The Dead Woman of Deptford (Inspector Ben Ross)</h2><p><p><b>THE DEAD WOMAN OF DEPTFORD is the sixth Inspector Ben Ross mystery set in Victorian London from much-loved crime writer Ann Granger.</b></p><p>On a cold November night in a Deptford yard, dock worker Harry Parker stumbles upon the body of a dead woman.

Love, Marriage and Other Surprises<br><br>The wedding took place underneath the Castle, beneath that towering, formidable rock, in a quiet church that was reached from King&#x2019;s Stables Road. Matthew and Elspeth Harmony had made their way there together, in a marked departure from the normal routine in which the groom arrives first, to be followed by the bride, but only after a carefully timed delay, enough to make the more anxious members of her family look furtively at their watches &#x2013; and wonder. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customs exist to be departed from, declared Matthew. He had pointedly declined to have a stag party with his friends but had nonetheless asked to be included in the hen party that had been organised for Elspeth. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Stag parties are dreadful,&#x201d; he pronounced. &#x201c;Everybody has too much to drink and the groom is subjected to all sorts of insults. Left without his trousers by the side of the canal and so on. I&#x2019;ve seen it.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not always,&#x201d; said Elspeth. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s up to you, Matthew.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was pleased that he was revealing himself not to be the type to enjoy a raucous male-only party. But this did not mean that Matthew should be allowed to come to her hen party, which was to consist of a dinner at Howie&#x2019;s restaurant in Bruntsfield, a sober do by comparison with the Bacchanalian scenes which some groups of young women seemed to go in for. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, new men might be new men, but they were still men, trapped in that role by simple biology. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Matthew,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that it&#x2019;s a good idea at all. The whole point about a hen party is that it&#x2019;s just for women. If a man were there it would change everything. The conversation would be different, for a start.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew wondered what it was that women talked about on such occasions. &#x201c;Different in what way?&#x201d; He did not intend to sound peevish, but he did. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just different,&#x201d; said Elspeth airily. She looked at him with curiosity. &#x201c;You do realise, Matthew, that men and women talk about rather different things? You do realise that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew thought of the conversations he had with his male friends. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if there&#x2019;s all that much difference,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I talk about the same things with my male and female friends. I don&#x2019;t make a distinction.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; said Elspeth. &#x201c;But the presence of a man would somehow interrupt the current. It&#x2019;s hard to say why, but it would.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the subject had been left there and Elspeth in due course enjoyed her hen party with seven of her close female friends, while Matthew went off by himself to the Cumberland Bar. There he met Angus Lordie sitting alone with his dog, Cyril. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I suppose that this is a sort of stag party for me,&#x201d; Matthew remarked to Angus. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath the table, Cyril, who had long wrestled with temptation to bite Matthew&#x2019;s ankles, suddenly leaned forward and licked them instead. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There, you see,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;When a dog licks you, it confers a benediction. Cyril understands, you know. That&#x2019;s his way of saying that he&#x2019;s going to be sorry to lose you.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s not going to lose me,&#x201d; protested Matthew. &#x201c;One doesn&#x2019;t completely disappear when one gets married.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus looked at Matthew with his slightly rheumy eyes. &#x201c;Really? Well, we won&#x2019;t be seeing much of you here after the event.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; said Matthew. He raised his glass of beer to his lips and looked at Angus. Angus was much older than he was and was unmarried, which meant either that there was some profound reason &#x2013; lack of interest &#x2013; or that he had been successful in evading commitment. Now, which of these was it? <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What about yourself, Angus?&#x201d; Matthew asked. &#x201c;Have you ever thought of . . . tying the knot with anybody?&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus smiled. &#x201c;Nobody would have me, I fear. Nothing would give me greater pleasure, I suspect, but, well, I&#x2019;ve never really got myself organised.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course, you&#x2019;d need to find somebody capable of taking on Cyril,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;And that wouldn&#x2019;t be easy.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus shot Matthew an injured glance and Matthew immediately realised his tactlessness. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Cyril is a slight problem,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s difficult being canine, you see. Lots of women turn their noses up at dogs. Particularly with Cyril being the sort of dog that he is. You know, a wandering eye and some unresolved personal freshness issues. But I wish people would see beyond that.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew nodded. Angus would be a task enough for any woman, and to add Cyril to the equation made it even more of a burden. <br><br>&#x201c;What about Domenica?&#x201d; he asked suddenly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always thought that you and she might make a good couple.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus looked wistfully at the ceiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve thought that too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s much of a chance there. She can&#x2019;t abide Cyril, you see, and I can hardly get rid of him after all these years. His heart would break.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;d get used to him,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;And dogs don&#x2019;t last forever.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus shook his head. &#x201c;No prospect,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s not talk about me and my problems. What about the wedding? I hear you&#x2019;ve got Charlie Robertson to do it for you. I knew him when he was at the Canongate Kirk. He does a nice line in weddings, and Her Majesty used to enjoy his sermons, I gather, when she was in residence at Holyrood. She must have had to listen to an awful lot of wheezy lectures from various archbishops of Canterbury &#x2013; it must have been so refreshing for her to get a good-going, no-nonsense sermon from somebody like Charlie. You know where you stand with the Church of Scotland, although as an Episcopalian, I must say there&#x2019;s a certain folksiness . . .&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re making certain changes,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re walking up the aisle together. And we&#x2019;re having a reading from Kahlil Gibran. You know, The Prophet. There&#x2019;s a chapter there about love and commitment.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus began to let out an involuntary groan, but stopped himself. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yes. Kahlil Gibran. I see. And the honeymoon?&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew leaned forward and whispered. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t told Elspeth. It&#x2019;s going to be a surprise. Australia!&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angus looked into his glass. For some inexplicable reason, he felt a sense of foreboding, as if a sinister angel had passed overhead and briefly looked down upon them, as one of those lumbering heavy bombers, laden with high explosive, may spot a target below &#x2013; a quiet lane with lovers popular, the innocent going about their business, a farmer driving a truck along a winding lane; irresistible temptations for a sinister angel. <br><br>2. By the Side of the Bridal Path <br><br>Inside the church, three hundred guests &#x2013; and a handful of regular members of St. Cuthbert&#x2019;s, entitled in that capacity to attend any service &#x2013; sat waiting for the ceremony to begin. Matthew had told Elspeth that she should invite as many friends as she wished. His father was paying for the wedding and had imposed no limits; his own list, Matthew felt, was at risk of being embarrassingly small: a few old friends from school, his father and his new wife, a couple of distant cousins, Angus Lordie, Domenica Macdonald, Big Lou, James Holloway; that was about all. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Pat, Matthew&#x2019;s former girlfriend and occasional employee, had been invited too, and had accepted. Much to Matthew&#x2019;s relief it appeared that she bore no ill-will towards the woman who had supplanted her in Matthew&#x2019;s affections; and for her part, Elspeth, by nature, was not one to be jealous. Matthew had reassured her that although he had been serious about Pat, his seriousness had been a mistake; misplaced seriousness, as he described it. &#x201c;She was really more of a sister,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I . . .&#x201d; He left the rest unsaid, and it was not referred to again. So many men might say &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I . . .&#x201d; when talking about the carnal, reflected Elspeth; all men might, in fact. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Elspeth had invited everyone in her address book and many who were not. All her colleagues from the Steiner School were there, her suspension having been formally rescinded after the evidence of the other children &#x2013; prominent among them Tofu &#x2013; that Olive&#x2019;s account of the incident in which the teacher had pinched her ear was at the very least confused, and more likely mendacious. But by the time her reputation was cleared she had already resigned, become engaged, and decided not to go back to teaching. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>As well as Elspeth&#x2019;s former colleagues, an invitation had been given to all the children in the class she had taught. They were to attend under the supervision of their new teacher, who had led them into the church as a group and taken them to the pews reserved for them up at the top on the left. Here they sat &#x2013; Merlin, Pansy, Lakshmi, Tofu, Hiawatha and the rest, hair neatly combed, their legs swinging freely, not quite touching the floor, whispering to each other, awed by the solemnity of the occasion and the significance of what was about to happen to their beloved Miss Harmony. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll probably have a baby in a couple of weeks,&#x201d; said Olive knowingly. &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s a girl. It&#x2019;ll be a big tragedy if it&#x2019;s a boy.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Tofu turned and sneered at her from the pew in front. &#x201c;Babies take time,&#x201d; he said, adding, &#x201c;stupid.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What do you know about it?&#x201d; hissed Olive. &#x201c;And anyway, no girl would ever marry you. Not in a hundred years.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;You mean that nobody would ever marry you,&#x201d; retorted Tofu. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d take one look at you and be sick.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to marry Bertie,&#x201d; said Olive smugly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s already asked me. We&#x2019;re going to get married when we&#x2019;re twenty. It&#x2019;s all settled.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Bertie, who was sitting a couple of places away from Olive heard this remark and froze. &#x201c;No, Olive, I didn&#x2019;t say I would,&#x201d; he protested. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Olive glared at him. &#x201c;You did!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You promised! Don&#x2019;t think you can break your promises like that.&#x201d; She snapped her fingers to demonstrate the speed of Bertie&#x2019;s broken promises, then looked at him and added, &#x201c;Especially in a church. God&#x2019;s really going to hate you, Bertie!&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This conversation was interrupted by the organist, who began to play a Bach prelude. Although the congregation was unaware of their presence, Matthew and Elspeth had already arrived and were sitting with Charlie Robertson in the chapel at the back of the church, a small, tucked-away room on the walls of which the names of the fallen were inscribed in lead, equal in death, with no distinction of rank, just men. Matthew, feeling awkward, gazed at the lists of names and thought: they were my age, or younger. Some were seventeen or eighteen, and were only in France or wherever it was for a week or two, days in some cases, before they died in that landscape of explosion and whistling metal. They didn&#x2019;t have a chance, and now here am I, whose life has been so easy, reading about them and their sacrifice. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>It was as if Charlie Robertson had read Matthew&#x2019;s thoughts. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been very fortunate, haven&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Being born at the time we were.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Matthew glanced at Elspeth. He reached for her hand. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;On a more cheerful note,&#x201d; said Charlie. &#x201c;Did you know that it was in this chapel that Agatha Christie got married?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Matthew showed his surprise. &#x201c;I would have thought that she would have been married in a sleepy little English village somewhere,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;In one of those places with an extraordinarily high murder rate.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Charlie laughed. &#x201c;I see what you mean,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But no. She got married here in Edinburgh. To her archaeologist husband. She said that an archaeologist was an ideal husband, as the older the wife became, the more interested he would be in her.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Matthew smiled. It was difficult to imagine Agatha Christie as being young; some people were remembered as how they became, rather than how they were; it was something to with names, he thought. Agatha was not a young name. &#x201c;But didn&#x2019;t she run away?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;That was earlier,&#x201d; said Elspeth, who knew something about Agatha Christie. &#x201c;Her first, dashing husband fell in love with somebody else. So she disappeared, and was eventually found staying at a hotel in Harrogate.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Charlie Robertson looked at his watch. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We should be thinking of starting. Are you two ready?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Matthew rose to his feet. Their conversation, innocent enough, had nevertheless made him think. In getting married, he realised, he was giving a hostage to fortune. By taking Elspeth into his life, the chances that the world would hurt him were doubled. She might leave him; she might run away, like Agatha Christie. There was so much that could go wrong in life if you took on somebody else, and then there were children and all the worries and anxiety they brought. There were so many reasons, he thought, for remaining single. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He looked at Elspeth, who was adjusting the veil she had pinned to her hair. I don&#x2019;t want to hurt you, thought Matthew; that&#x2019;s the last thing I want. But should I really go through with this? Is it wise?</p><h2>Madder Music, Stronger Wine: The Life of Ernest Dowson, Poet and Decadent</h2><p>Ernest Dowson, one of the major poets of the romantic late Victorian Decadent period, died in 1900 at the age of 32, an alcoholic and a severe depressive. He created much of his best work when he was suffering from the tuberculosis which was finally to kill him. This little understood major figure of the Victorian literary world wrote some of the most quoted lyrics in English verse in the company of contemporaries such as Oscar Wilde and W. B. Yeats. This full biography explores Dowson&#x2019;s strange delights and sexual excesses while providing fascinating insights into the bohemian circles of London and Paris in the romantic fin de siecle period, and the bizarre and outrageous characters who made up "the Decadents".<br></p><p>Jad Adams is a producer of history documentaries and Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.<br>"...Adams is thorough in detailing the good and the bad about the writer...<i>" --Boston Globe</i> <br></p><h2>Seeing Lhasa: British Depictions of the Tibetan Capital, 1936-1947</h2><p>Recent donations to the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, UK, of vintage photos and films by British travelers to Tibet, prompted an exhibit and this book.

The plot renders a version of the famous Beiliss trial, in which a Jew was accused in Czarist Russia of murdering a Gentile child in order to have Christian blood with which to bake Passover matzohs--the pathetic blood libel that's roiled Russian anti-Semitism for time immemorial (it was also the basis for Bernard Malamud's The Fixer). Here, two student friends get the at-first whimsical idea of trading places, Gentile with a Jew and vice versa: Grigori Popov becomes Hersh Rabinovich for a year, enrolls in dental school, and is eventually the suspect in the child murder. Meanwhile, the real Rabinovitch is living in relative splendor as a private tutor in another city. Both students fall in love with young women they cannot have--the cross-religious secret--and Aleichem keeps things moving by relentless comparison between mores, destinies, entitlements, strategies. Not surprisingly, the sections focusing on the false-Rabinovitch in the home of his landlord's family, the Shapiros, are the ones where Aleichem's characteristic humor and acute sociology fall best into place--especially about indignation and resignation as seemingly racial traits. Fairly mechanical and not as startling as the best Aleichem, but the authorial kibitzing (``In another room, Betty was creating a new coiffure, which was a pity. To take the hair with which nature had blessed her and to try to force it into some artificial style--feh!'') and muscular attack of the whole make it still characteristic of the author. Aliza Shevrin does the knotty job of translating all of this (the false-Rabinovitch is all at sea with Yiddish and is forever mispronouncing) quite well. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is the singer and songwriter of the band Richmond Fontaine and a member of the band The Delines. He lives outside Portland, Oregon.In a gritty debut, Vlautin explores a few weeks in the broken lives of two working-class brothers, Frank and Jerry Lee Flannigan, who abruptly ditch their Reno motel after Jerry Lee drunkenly kills a boy on a bicycle in a hit-and-run. The two are case studies in hard luck: their mother died when they were 14 and 16, respectively; their father is an ex-con deadbeat; neither finished high school. Frank has had just one girlfriend, motel neighbor Annie, whose mother is an abusive prostitute. An innocent simpleton, Jerry Lee is left feeling suicidal after the accident, despite his younger brother's efforts (� la <i>Of Mice and Men's </i>Lenny and George) to console him: "It was real quiet, the way he cried," says Frank, "like he was whimpering." On returning to Reno, an eventual reckoning awaits them. Vlautin's coiled, poetically matter-of-fact prose calls to mind S.E. Hinton&#x2014;a writer well-acquainted with male misfit protagonists seeking redemption, no matter how destructive. Despite the bleak story and its inevitably tragic ending, Vlautin, who plays in the alt-country band Richmond Fontaine, transmits a quiet sense of resilience and hopefulness. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Parakilas and his colleagues have struck a canny balance between scholarly rigor and popular appeal, with chapters alternating between more or less straightforward historical surveys and informal essays on such offbeat topics as the piano less, the piano in the movies, and the piano in Japan, and even the evolution of the piano bench. This is a beautiful book that is equally fascinating to read and fun to look at.</p><p>Praise for the earlier edition: "In turns highly entertaining and very educational, full of extraordinary facts. An admirable addition to the literature on this subject."&#x2014;Andr� Previn "Reach[es] out to general readers as well as musical insiders. . . . [A] fascinating cultural history."&#x2014; Anthony Tommasini, New York Times "A book that will tell you everything you want to know about the piano, except maybe how to play it. . . . [The book] is replete with artworks, photos, history, anecdotes, and reminiscences." &#x2014;Herbert Kupferberg, Houston Chronicle "A wonderful mosaic of the history of the piano and the diverse parts it has played in its three hundred years of life."&#x2014;Henry Sheen, New StatesmanJames Parakilas is professor of music and chair of the Humanities Division at Bates College. A performing pianist, he also helped organise the Piano 300 exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution marking the tercentenary of the invention of the piano.</p><h2>Bad Blood (Crimson Moon, Book 1)</h2><p><p>Sasha Trudeau knows all about working beneath the shadows, back-alley deals, and things that go bump in the night.

While I am walking these plains and mountains for the first time, there is this feeling that a part of me is eternal, that I have known these old trails before. I believe it is the undying spirit of the frontier calling, allowing me, through the mind&#x2019;s eye, to step back into time. What is the appeal of the Old West of the American frontier?</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>It has been epitomized by some as the dark and bloody period in American history. Its heroes&#x2014;Crockett, Bowie, Hickok, Earp&#x2014;have been reviled and criticized. Yet the Old West lives on, larger than life.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>It has become a symbol of freedom, when there was always another mountain to climb and another river to cross; when a dispute between two men was settled not with expensive lawyers, but with fists, knives, or guns. Barbaric? Maybe. But some things never change. When the cowboy rode into the pages of American history, he left behind a legacy that lives within the hearts of us all.</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Ralph Compton</i></p><p>Prologue</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t hear me, which was how I wanted it. I slipped into the canyon well before the moon rose above the east rim and worked my way down to their shack. Gruff voices and an occasional laugh told me they were there. In the corral were the thirty head they had stolen.</p><p>I firmed my grip on the scattergun and stalked to within a pebble&#x2019;s toss of a side window, which was covered by a piece of hide. No one could see in, and no one could see out either, unless they moved the hide. Training both barrels on the square of light, I cat footed to the corner.</p><p>So far, so good. But in my profession it&#x2019;s the yet-to-do that can do you in. I crept toward the front door. With any luck I could kick it in and let them have both barrels before they so much as blinked.</p><p>I&#x2019;m partial to shotguns for close-in work. Mine was a double-barreled twelve-gauge made by an outfit in England. I&#x2019;d sawed off all but six inches of barrel and whittled down the stock to a stub so I could carry it under my slicker, or, for that matter, under my vest, with no one the wiser. All I had to do was loop a piece of rawhide over my shoulder so the scattergun hung free and easy, and I was in business.</p><p>I was maybe two steps from the door when I thumbed back the first hammer. With the noise they were making, I figured they wouldn&#x2019;t hear. What I didn&#x2019;t count on was Ned Wheatley having to heed nature&#x2019;s call. Light spilled into the night, catching me in its glare, and it was hard to say who was more surprised, the old rustler or me.</p><p>To his credit Wheatley didn&#x2019;t panic. He kept his wits about him and clawed for his Smith &amp; Wesson, bawling over his shoulder, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s him, boys! Lucifer himself!&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been called a lot of things but never that, although when you think about it, it fits. The flattery aside, I let Ned Wheatley have the right barrel full in the gut, which had the same effect as cutting loose on a cantaloupe at that range. Wheatley was lifted off his feet and flew backward, his innards exploding every which way. I truly believe he was dead before he smashed into the table and upended it and a couple of chairs, besides.</p><p>The other three were caught with cards or glasses in their hands. Spike Thompson recovered first and snaked a hand for his Colt. I gave him the second barrel square, as much for the splatter as for the fact that Spike was the one who bragged in town that no so-called miserable excuse for a Regulator would ever make worm food of him. A person should be careful what they say.</p><p>Some of the gore caught Festus Blish in the face and Festus instinctively jerked away. It slowed his draw. My Remington cleared leather before his revolver. I shot him in the chest and he started to melt, but I was already spinning toward the last rustler.</p><p>Pettigrew was on his feet. He favored a cross-draw and he was pretty slick at it, too, but in his haste he snagged his long-barreled Whitney on the table. I shot him between the eyes, then crouched to finish off those that needed finishing, but they were all down and would stay down this side of evermore.</p><p>Folks say I&#x2019;m a cold-blooded cuss, but with all the body parts and brains and whatnot lying about, I needed a drink as much as the next man. I leaned against the jamb, took out my flask, and treated myself to a healthy swig. The coffin varnish burned clear down to my toes.</p><p>I smacked my lips in satisfaction at a job well done. Of course, it doesn&#x2019;t do to put the cart before the horse, and I had a lot of work left to do before I could collect. There&#x2019;s another gent in the same business who likes to put rocks under the heads of those he kills, but me, I take their ears. That way I&#x2019;ve got proof, yet I don&#x2019;t have to tote the bodies all over creation. I shucked my boot knife and set to work, and soon my pouch bulged with eight ears.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t bury the deceased. Hell, why should I? It wasn&#x2019;t likely anyone would pay their shack a visit before all the flesh rotted from their bones, so I let them be. That, and I&#x2019;m as lazy as the next man.</p><p>Brisco was where I had left him. The roan knew better than to run off. The last time he pulled that stunt, I staked him out under the hot sun for three days without water. Nothing like a powerful thirst to teach a horse to mind its betters.</p><p>I headed for the Tyler spread. I admit I was feeling pretty good. Soon my nest egg would grow. But once again I was mixing my carts and my horses. Until you have the money in hand, never spend it in your head.</p><p>Judging by the North Star, midnight came and went by the time I drew rein in front of the main house. I was bone tired after a week on the stalk, so I wasn&#x2019;t as alert as I should be. Which explains why the <i>click</i> of the hammer took me unawares. Naturally, I hiked my hands and said, &#x201c;Hold on, hoss. Your boss is expecting me.&#x201d;</p><p>I reckoned it was one of the hands. But no, it was the big sugar himself, Bryce Tyler, who strode out of the shadows into the moonlight, a level Winchester at his hip. &#x201c;Am I, now?&#x201d; he said with a grin.</p><p>I relaxed and started to lower my hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep reaching for the sky,&#x201d; Tyler said.</p><p>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; I was mighty confused.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it done?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s done,&#x201d; I snapped, annoyed by his treatment. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m here to collect the rest of my fee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Five hundred in advance and five hundred after,&#x201d; Tyler quoted our agreement, his bald pate bobbing. &#x201c;Did you bring them?&#x201d;</p><p>I started to reach under my vest for the pouch but thought better of the notion. &#x201c;The ears? Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re not part Apache?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever gave you that notion?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How else can you do the things you do? What does this make? Twenty-nine? And you without ever so much as a scratch.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t decide if he was serious or poking fun.</p><p>&#x201c;Then there&#x2019;s this business with the ears. What kind of depraved human being mutilates folks like that? What sort of man are you, Lucius Stark? How is it you&#x2019;re so fond of killing?&#x201d;</p><p>Forgetting myself, I shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a job. I do what I have to. Now, suppose I give you the ears and you give me the rest of the money I&#x2019;m due, and we part company and go our separate ways?&#x201d;</p><p>That was how it should be. When we first met, we shook hands, sealing our word. Nine times out of ten those who hire me prove trustworthy. But there is always that tenth time, that tenth hombre, who thinks that giving his word to a Regulator is not really giving his word at all.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking,&#x201d; Tyler said.</p><p>I swore.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, now. Let&#x2019;s keep a civil tongue. Five hundred is more than enough for four measly rustlers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We agreed to a thousand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, we did, but that was before I sat down and talked it over with my wife.&#x201d;</p><p>There it was. He had come right out and admitted it. &#x201c;We also agreed no one else was to know you hired me. It was one of the conditions I set. Remember?&#x201d;</p><p>Tyler took another step, the Winchester&#x2019;s muzzle pointed at my head. &#x201c;Conditions change. I didn&#x2019;t feel right not telling her. She has as much of a stake in this ranch as I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You gave your word,&#x201d; I reminded him. I always reminded them. Not that it ever did any good.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lecture me, assassin,&#x201d; Tyler spat. &#x201c;Just take the five hundred and go. Take the ears, too, because I sure as hell don&#x2019;t want them.&#x201d;</p><p>By then I was good and mad. If there is anything I hate worse than a no-account who goes back on his word, I have yet to come across it. &#x201c;What about your missus?&#x201d;</p><p>The question caused him to blink. &#x201c;What about her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe your wife wants the ears to hang over the mantel. Trophies of the time you hired a Regulator and made a damn fool out of him by cheating him and sending him skulking away with his tail between his legs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t much like your tone,&#x201d; Tyler said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll thank you not to speak ill of my wife. She is the salt of the earth, my Mildred. It was her brainstorm to hire you in the first place.&#x201d;</p><p>I was flabbergasted. He had lied all along. He and the missus had planned the whole thing, including their swindle of me. I gave him one last chance, though. Folks say I don&#x2019;t have a shred of decency in me, but they don&#x2019;t have to put up with the nitwits I have to put up with. Like the Tylers. &#x201c;Please. I&#x2019;m asking you nicely. Give me my money and I&#x2019;ll be out of your hair.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Apostolic Calling Expanded: Identifying Your Apostolic Call</h2><p><p><b>The Apostolic Calling Expanded</b></p> <p>The Apostolic Calling is the definitive teaching by Apostle Les on the call to the Apostolic Office.

Carr has emerged as the cultural historian of the New York underground and the foremost critic of performance art. On Edge brings together her writings to offer a detailed and insightful history of this vibrant brand of theatre from the late 70s to today. It represents both Carr's analysis as a critic and her testament as a witness to performances which, by their very nature, can never be repeated.<br><br>Carr has organized this collection both chronologically and thematically, ranging from the emphasis on bodily manipulation/endurance in the 70s to the underground club scene in New York to an insider's analysis of the Tompkins Square Riot as a manifestation of the cultural and social conflicts that underlie much of performance art. She examines the transgressive and taboo-shattering work of Ethyl Eichelberger, Karen Finley, and Holly Hughes; documents specific performances by Annie Sprinkle and Lydia Lunch; and maps the development of such artists as Robbie McCauley, Blue Man Group, and John Jesurun. She also describes the "cross-over" phenomenon of the mid-80s and considers the far-right backlash against this mainstreaming as cultural reactionaries sought to curb the influence of these new artists.<br><br>CONTRIBUTORS: Linda Montano, Chris Burden, G.G Allin, Jean Baudrillard, Patty Hearts, Dan Quayle, Anne Magnouson, John Jesurun, John Kelly, Shu Lea Changvv, Diamanda Galas, Salley May, Rafael Mantanez Ortiz, Sherman Fleming, Kristine Stiles, Laurie Carlos, Jessica Hafedorn, Robbie McCormick, Karen Finley, Poopo Shiraishi, Donna Henes, Holey Hughe, Ela Troyano, Michael Smith, Harry Koipper, John Sex, Nina Jagen, Ethyl Eichelberge, Marina Abramovic, Ulay.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 27 illus.

From a growing concern with industrial accidents in the 1880s through the shell shock "epidemic" of the war, male hysteria seemed to bespeak the failings of German masculinity. In response, psychiatrists struggled to turn male-hysterical bodies into fit workers and loyal political subjects.</p><p>Medical approaches to trauma valorized work and productivity as standards of male health, and psychiatric treatment&#x2015;whether through hypnosis, electric current, or suggestion&#x2015;concentrated on turning debilitated soldiers into symptom-free workers. These concerns endured through the Weimar period, as "nervous veterans" competed for disability compensation amid the republic's political crises and economic upheavals.</p><p><i>Hysterical Men</i> shows how wartime psychiatry furthered the process of medical rationalization. Lerner views this not as a precursor to the brutalities of Nazi-era psychiatry, but rather as characteristic of a more general medicalized modernity. The author asserts, however, that psychiatry's continual skepticism toward trauma resonated powerfully with the radical right's celebration of war and violence and its supposedly salutary effects on men and nations.</p></p><p>"The subject of <i>Hysterical Men</i> is of considerable relevance to communities of readers interested in the history of psychiatry, war psychiatry, and hysteria. Among the many books published on these subjects, Lerner's is original, lucid, well organized, and superbly documented."--Allan Young, McGill University <p> </p><p>"An absorbing account of the human toll of World War One, exhaustively researched, engagingly presented, and infinitely topical. Lerner sees medical history as cultural history, and his case studies are as poignant as they are terrifying. The monstrosity of war becomes palpable in these pages."--Anton Kaes, University of California, Berkeley</p>Paul Lerner is Associate Professor of History at the University of Southern California where he directs the Max Kade Institute for Austrian-German-Swiss Studies. He is the author of <i>Hysterical Men: War, Psychiatry, and the Politics of Trauma in Germany, 1890&#x2013;1930</i>, also from Cornell, and coeditor of <i>The Consuming Temple</i> and <i>Traumatic Pasts: History, Psychiatry, and Trauma in the Modern Age, 1870&#x2013;1930</i>.</p><h2>Quest Of The Mountain Man</h2><p>Smoke Jenson and a band of tough mountain men from the Colorado Rockies must battle against a brutal gang of cross-border outlaws who are determined to halt the progress of the railroad - by any means necessary.

In this book, Professor Haley fives us a lively portrait of Dutch society from the foundation of he republic in 1570 to the beginning of its eighteenth-century &#39;decline&#39;: he reveals its political and religious tolerance, its cultural vitality, its concern for learning and the humane treatment of the poor. Granting a special position to the princes of Orange, the nation based its political institutions on a pragmatic solution of the conflict between demands for local autonomy and the need for some form of centralized authority. This vigorous good sense was reflected in the basis of Dutch strength - a prosperous world-wide trade, backed by merchants of acumen and initiative. A remarkable collection of contemporary illustrations supports this cogent survey of a country which, in little more than a century, developed from a group of disunited provinces into a power of world significance.</p><p></p><h2>Women (TWENTIETH-CENTURY CONTINENTAL FICTION)</h2><p>Will, a mysogynist American journalist-turned-novelist, carries on erotic encounters with women during globe-trotting stints, all the while suspecting their entire gender of staging a genetic revolution to restore cultural matriarchy</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchSollers, editor of Tel Quel (now L'infini) and author of experimental texts ( H. ; Le Parc ), has written here what is, on the surface, a conventional roman a clef--Barthes, Lacan, Foucault and others roam its edges--but which is, at a deeper level, an unforgiving portrait of European intellectual culture. The narrator, Will, is an expatriate American journalist capable of but one conviction--"The world belongs to women. In other words, to death." Women is the novel he is writing as he travels the world recording his views on political terrorism, Maoism and the dozens of females he encounters along the way. Despite the ennui that engulfs Will and his countless sexual partners, the narration is buoyed by extraordinary improvisations that keep the reader sailing. The audacious description of a real-life Emma Bovary, circa 1984stet , who expresses "great admiration for Flaubert" but who criticizes the great French writer for describing her "burgeoning love for Rodolphe in parallel to the lowing of cattle," is scandalously funny. Given Sollers's own political activism, one can only suppose that in the boorish, self-absorbed Will he has created a fictional object of transference for a generation of idealists now clutched in doubt. Bray's translation makes brilliant accommodation to both the lyrical swing and the hard poetry of Sollers's imagination. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tight Lines</h2><p>Brady Coyne&#39;s dying client wants him to find her estranged daughter--an only child who ran off with an older man--but Coyne&#39;s investigation runs into a dead end</p><p>William G. Tapply was the author of dozens of books, including more than two dozen New England-based mystery novels and nearly a thousand magazine articles, mostly about fly fishing and the outdoors. Tapply died in July 2009 after a battle with Leukemia. He lived and wrote in Hancock, New Hampshire.Lawyer of choice to wealthy Bostonians, Brady Coyne avoids the term attorney for the pretensions it suggests. But at the behest of his old friend Susan Ames, descendant of an eminent family who have occupied the same Concord house since 1748, he enters into rarified social circles to trace the whereabouts of Susan's only child, Mary Ellen, who all but vanished while a college student 11 years earlier. With little time left for terminally ill Susan why? is she dying? well you might ask/sss and not much information, Brady patiently pursues lines of inquiry. Three murders occur during his investigation, during which he also pays attention to his divorced wife (whom he still calls "hon") and begins a relationship with a captivating stranger. In his measured style, Brady moves through Boston's fascinating environs and the colorful autumn countryside of New England as new avenues constantly open up in this well-crafted plot. Having come to know Tapply's vividly depicted characters--where they live, what they wear, what they eat and drink, how they think and feel--readers will delight in the tale's surprising, convincing resolution. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fundations Student Notebook, Second Edition, Level 3</h2><p>Used by students as a reference for letter formation, keyword pictures, and sounds, plus vocabulary and trick words.

In fact, Parker has enhanced the stitching techniques through her very own innovations--practice strategies as well as the use of heat transfer interfacings. With those new methods and a sewing machine, the once labor-consuming task of running stitches becomes a joy--and a true act of creation. To that end, 25 projects are featured, ranging from a sampler table runner to decorative screen panels; additionally, the author presents a detailed and engaging history of sashiko and more than 100 stitch patterns, each with Japanese history, recommendations for use, and two examples (one in blue on white, the other white on blue). A mouth-watering "gotta try" wealth of designs and information. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i>Sashiko is traditional Japanese quilting, usually done in white running stitch on indigo fabric. Machine-stitched sashiko has a somewhat different appearance but is just as striking. The emphasis in this book is on patterns that may be continuously stitched across the fabric without stopping to tie off. Parker, a teacher of sashiko workshops, provides a dictionary of continuous patterns, instructions for successful stitching, and a sections of fairly easy projects for pillows and table linens. A good selection for public libraries on a topic of increasing interest to American stitchers. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dominion of War: Empire and Liberty in North America, 1500-2000</h2><p>A reinterpretation of the development of the United States argues that warfare has played a leading role in shaping North America throughout the past five hundred years, in a history that focuses on the lives of eight men including George Washington, Ulysses S.

Dorchester</h2><p>Four military chaplains board the U.S.A.T Dorchester to minister to the 902 soldiers on board.</p><p>Ken Wales has enjoyed a long and successful career in film and television. His acclaimed accomplishments include the film The Tamarind Seed, and the award-winning miniseries John Steinbeck's East of Eden. His passion and vision brought Catherine Marshall's acclaimed Christy series to CBS Television. Ken is a professor and mentor at his alma mater, The University of Southern California, School of Cinema. He and his wife live in Pacific Palisades, California. <p>David Poling is the first cousin of one of the four chaplains, Clark V. Poling. He is the past president of Christian Herald Publishing Company, and currently is serving as vice president for Americana Publishing, Inc. He and his wife currently reside in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>Does factual history make for good fiction? Well, yes and no in this military novel with strong spiritual themes. Father John Washington, Rev. Clark Poling, Pastor George Fox and Rabbi Alex Goode are thrown together on the doomed army transport ship Dorchester in February 1943. As Nazi U-boats lurk just beneath the surface of the western Atlantic, waiting to intercept and destroy ships that pass within torpedo range, spiritual battles take place on board the Dorchester. Not, however, among the clergy. Despite their diverse religious traditions Catholic, Jewish, Methodist and Reformed Protestant the four chaplains find a consistent unity of purpose in boosting the spirits of the military men under their care. Indeed, the spiritual unity is unbelievably idyllic: some disagreement or tension among the four might have made their relationship more convincing. However, the final sacrifice they make based on true accounts is undisputedly inspiring. The novel's strength lies in its detailed depiction of a heavily researched historical event; this is also a weakness, as the reader often feels more like a history pupil than a participant in the adventure. This story might have been better presented as nonfiction. Still, history buffs who prefer a Christian theme in their novels will be happy to find a new offering in the limited pool of titles available to them, and WWII fans will enjoy this retelling of the sinking of the Dorchester. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>World of Knitted Toys</h2><p>Here are animals from every corner of the globe just waiting to become someone&#39;s best friend.

Whether your horse is a foal or five, guilelessly green or imperfectly veteran, he will benefit from the Countdown&#x2014;a true "foundation" program, serving to prepare him for the endless variety of activities and "jobs" horses perform today. From indispensable handling, "sacking-out," and tying exercises, to how you, the rider, can control the different parts of the horse&#x2019;s body from the ground and the saddle; from mounting on both the left and the right to performing flawless flying lead changes, you&#x2019;ll be amazed at how effective and efficient this program is.</p><p><b>Sean Patrick</b> has been working with horses&nbsp;since 1992, is a former high-country guide, and writes for <i>Trail Blazer </i>magazine.

Tour.</p><p>Paul Perry is a New York Times bestselling author and a documentary filmmaker whose work has appeared on PBS.This unauthorized biography takes off only when Perry, a former editor of Running magazine, describes the wacky/scary experience of engaging legendary gonzo journalist Thompson to report on the Honolulu Marathon in 1980, and when Thompson's illustrator sidekick Ralph Steadman tells of Thompson's paranoid trip to cover a heavyweight title bout in Zaire. Otherwise, Perry ( On the Bus ) interweaves insights from Thompson's associates with excerpts from Thompson's writings to produce a straightforward portrait far less manic than its subject is purported to be. The author describes the young Hunter as a wild drinker and voracious reader like his mother, and a poor kid who was an outsider among the Louisville elite. He traces Thompson's career from military sportswriter to gonzo glory in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to his covering of the 1972 presidential campaign. Thompson acknowledged that only 75% of what he wrote was accurate. Nor does Perry ignore Thompson's prodigious use of drugs and alcohol, violence toward women, attempts at writing fiction and his bizarre race for sheriff of Aspen in 1970. By the 1970s, the author writes, Thompson became a prisoner of his image, and perhaps because of this Perry's account of Thompson's last decade is thin.

John Leland is arrested for fatally stabbing Iris Jantzen, stepmother of his fiancee, Anne Kimbro, who engages Mason to save her beloved. With Della Street and Paul Drake, the attorney searches for facts to refute the mass of evidence against Leland. But information about an earlier murder in the same house where Iris was killed further incriminates the accused, who repeatedly disappears while shrewd Mason, preparing for the trial, looks elsewhere for a suspect. Will the great lawyer crush the opposition at the height of the courtroom proceedings? Of course.

Winner of an Edgar Award, a Gold Dagger for fiction, a Diamond Dagger for career excellence, and the Chandler-Fulbright Award, he lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.Steven Pacey has great fun with this early Rankin work. Written in 1994 under the pseudonym Jack Harvey, this is a thriller with a little bit of everything, including an alcoholic ex-cop, a heart-of-gold assassin, lovable gun dealers, and a love story. There's also lots of bloodshed as the story moves from London to Yorkshire to Scotland to New York to Texas to Seattle to London. Amid all this, Pacey plays every role confidently and at full throttle--a one-man complete international cast. Between conversations, the pacing is quick and clear, and the voice, very pleasant.

Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>A Short History of the Korean War</h2><p><p>As pungent and concise as his short histories of both world wars, Stokesbury's survey of "the half war" takes a broad view and seems to leave nothing out but the details. The first third covers the North Korean invasion of June 1950, the Pusan perimeter crisis, MacArthur's master stroke at Inchon and the intervention by Chinese forces that November. At this point, other popular histories of the war reach the three-quarter mark, ending often with a cursory summary of the comparatively undramatic three-and-a-half years required to bring the war to its ambiguous conclusion on July 27, 1953. Stokesbury renders the latter period as interesting as the operational fireworks of the first six months: the Truman-MacArthur controversy; the political limitations on U.S. air power; the need for the Americans to fight the war as cheaply as possible, due to NATO commitments; the prolonged negotiations at Panmunjom over the prisoner-exchange issue; and the effect of the war on the home front. Whether the United States could have/should have stayed out of the war in the first place comes under discussion: "no" on both counts, according to the author.</p></p><p>James L. Stokesbury is the author of <em>A Short History of World War I, A Short History of World War II, A Short History of the Korean War, </em>and<em> A Short History of the American Revolution.</em> Before his death in 1995 he was a professor of history at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada.Reducing an entire war to manageable length is a high literary art form, and Professor Stokesbury has mastered it. In the case of this Korean War history, short does not mean banal condensation or a dismal list of statistics and facts. Rather, Stokesbury begins from scratch and describes and interprets each phase of the war, as he did in his readable and well-known short histories of World Wars I and II. The narrative makes good sense of the infantry's complicated battlefield movements; and his interpretation of the air war is exemplary. The result is a concise but totally independent history that can stand alongside any of the recent crop of new Korean War titles. Raymond L.

It is with pride that we make it available again in a one-volume edition.</p><p><b>Harry Austryn Wolfson</b> was Nathan Littauer Professor of Hebrew Literature and Philosophy, Emeritus, Harvard University.Wolfson has tracked Spinoza to his lair in a work of scholarship and erudition hard to duplicate. <i>The Philosophy of Spinoza</i> is a commentary, frequently brilliant and revelatory, on every definition, axiom and proposition of the <i>Ethics</i>...He argues his thesis with persuasion and wit...and writes in a style that is a model of clarity. His is a work of first magnitude. (<i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>No one will read his book without being stirred to enthusiasm for its rigorous comprehensiveness, its scrupulous lucidity, and the asceticism of its devotion not only to the thought of Spinoza, but to that vast learning to which Spinoza fell heir. (<i>Saturday Review</i>)<br><br>When the investigation is of such magistral scholarship and pointed clarity as this longawaited work...it is of moment that it be called to the attention of all laymen with the least pretensions to philosophy. Wolfson's scholarship is just such as to give the reader the help in understanding Spinoza that he needs.

More than 3,000 entries, illustrated with some 1,000 photographs, feature oddball contraptions and their eccentric designers, as well as the big companies whose aircraft have become household names. So, along with big organizations like Grumman, Messerschmitt, Supermarine and Sikorsky, are the enthusiasts who built a single machine in their backyard or, like V.B. Shavrov, in their tiny one-bedroom apartment! Global in scope, this new edition reflects the fundamental changes that have occurred in the aviation industry since the turn of the millennium. Each entry indicates the nationality of the company or individual concerned; while it may not come as much of a surprise to see the USA, France, the UK and Germany heading the league table of countries with the most manufacturers, readers may be interested to discover Brazil with 35, South Korea with eight - and the Channel Islands and Luxembourg with one entry apiece.</p><p>Bill Gunston OBE is a former RAF pilot and the prolific author of more than 350 published books on aspects of aviation.

In the early-morning hours, a breeze came through the terrace doors Chantel had left unlatched, bringing in the scents of the garden. Across the lawn, hidden from the main house by trees, was a gazebo, painted white, with wisteria climbing up the trellises. Sometimes, when the wind was right, Chantel could catch the perfume from her bedroom window.<br><br>On the east side of the lawn was an elaborate marble fountain. It was quiet now. She rarely had it turned on when she was alone. Near it was the pool, an octagonal stone affair skirted by a wide patio and flanked by another, smaller, white house. There was a tennis court beyond a grove of trees, but it had been weeks since she'd had the time or the inclination to pick up a racket.<br><br>Surrounding the estate was a stone fence, twice as tall as a man, that alternately gave her a sense of security or the feeling of being hemmed in. Still, inside the house, with its lofty ceilings and cool white walls, she often forgot about the fence and the security system and the electronic gate; it was the price she paid for the fame she had always wanted.<br><br>The servants' quarters were in the west wing, on the first floor. No one stirred there now. It was barely dawn, and she was alone. There were times Chantel preferred it that way.<br><br>As she bundled her hair under a hat, she didn't bother to check the results in the three-foot mirror in her dressing room. The long shirt and flat-heeled shoes she wore were chosen for comfort, not for elegance. The face that had broken men's hearts and stirred women's envy was left untouched by cosmetics. Chantel protected it by pulling down the brim of her hat and slipping on enormous sunglasses. As she picked up the bag that held everything she thought she would need for the day, the intercom beside the door buzzed.<br><br>She checked her watch. Five forty-five. Then she pushed the button. "Right on time."<br><br>"Good morning, Miss O'Hurley."<br><br>"Good morning, Robert. I'll be right down." After flipping the switch that released the front gate, Chantel started down the wide double staircase that led to the main floor. The mahogany rail felt like satin under her fingers as she trailed them down. Overhead, a chandelier hung, its prisms quiet in the dim light. The marble floor shone like glass. The house was a suitable showcase for the star she had worked to become. Chantel had yet to take any of it for granted. It was a dream that had rolled from, then into, other dreams, and it took time and effort and skill to maintain. But then she'd been working all her life and felt entitled to the benefits she had begun to reap.<br><br>As she walked to the front door, the phone began to ring.<br><br>Damn it, had they changed the call on her? Because she was up and the servants weren't, Chantel crossed the hall to the library and lifted the receiver. "Hello." Automatically she picked up a pen and prepared to make a note.<br><br>"I wish I could see you right now." The familiar whisper had her palms going damp, and the pen slipped out of her hand and fell soundlessly on the fresh blotter. "Why did you change your number? You're not afraid of me, are you? You mustn't be afraid of me, Chantel. I won't hurt you. I just want to touch you. Just touch you. Are you getting dressed? Are you&#x2014;"<br><br>With a cry of despair, Chantel slammed down the receiver. The sound of her breathing in the big, empty house seemed to echo back to her. It was starting again.<br><br>Minutes later, her driver noticed only that she didn't give him the easy, flirtatious smile she usually greeted him with before she climbed into the back of the limo. Once inside, Chantel tipped her head back, closed her eyes and willed herself to calm. She had to face the camera in a few hours and give it her best. That was her job. That was her life. Nothing could be allowed to interfere with that, not even the fear of a whisper over the phone or an anonymous letter.<br><br>By the time the limo passed through the studio gates, Chantel had herself under control again. She should be safe here, shouldn't she? Here she could pour herself into the work that still fascinated her. Inside the dozens of big domed buildings, magic happened, and she was part of it. Even the ugliness was just pretend. Murder, mayhem and passion could all be simulated. Fan-tasyland, her sister Maddy called it, and that was true enough. But, Chantel thought with a smile, you had to work your tail off to make the fantasy real.<br><br>She was sitting in makeup at six-thirty and having her hair fussed over and styled by seven. They were in the first week of shooting, and everything seemed fresh and new. Chantel read over her lines while the stylist arranged her hair into the flowing silver-blond mane her character would wear that day.<br><br>"Such incredible bulk," the stylist murmured as she aimed the hand-held dryer. "I know women who would sell their blue-chip stocks for hair as thick as this. And the color!" She bent down to eye level to look in the mirror at the results of her work. "Even I have a hard time believing it's natural."<br><br>"My grandmother on my father's side." Chantel turned her head a bit to check her left profile. "I'm supposed to be twenty in this scene, Margo. Am I going to pull it off?"<br><br>With a laugh, the stringy redhead stood back. "That's the least of your worries. It's a shame they're going to dump rain all over this." She gave Chantel's hair a final fluff.<br><br>"You're telling me." Chantel stood when the bib was removed. "Thanks, Margo." Before she'd taken two steps, her assistant was at her elbow. Chantel had hired him because he was young and eager and had no ambitions to be an actor. "Are you going to crack the whip, Larry?"<br><br>Larry Washington flushed and stuttered, as he always did during his first five minutes around Chantel. He was short and well built, fresh out of college, and had a mind that soaked up details. His biggest ambition at the moment was to own a Mercedes. "Oh, you know I'd never do that, Miss O'Hurley."<br><br>Chantel patted his shoulder, making his blood pressure soar. "Somebody has to. Larry, I'd appreciate it if you'd scout up the assistant director and tell him I'm in my trailer. I'm going to hide out there until they're ready to rehearse." Her co-star came into view carrying a cigarette and what Chantel accurately gauged to be a filthy hangover.<br><br>"Would you like me to bring you some coffee, Miss O'Hurley?" As he asked, Larry shifted to distance himself. Everyone with brains had quickly figured out that it was best to avoid Sean Carter when he was dealing with the morning after.<br><br>"Yes, thanks." Chantel nodded to a few members of the crew as they tightened up the works on the first set, a train station, complete with tracks, passenger cars and a depot. She'd say her desperate goodbyes to her lover there. She could only hope he'd gotten his headache under control by then.<br><br>Larry kept pace with her as she crossed the set, walking under lights and around cables. "I wanted to remind you about your interview this afternoon. The reporter from <em>Star Gaze</em> is due here at twelve-thirty.

This sumptuous catalogue of an exhibition at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art reproduces mysterious brass heads of monarchs and queen mothers, palace plaques teeming with relief figures, regal roosters atop ancestral altars, carved ivory tusks and pyramid-shaped bells. Ezra, an associate curator of the museum, makes it clear in her informative text that this art is intimately linked to rituals of divine kingship and religion, as can be seen in complex altar tableaux depicting the king surrounded by courtiers, chiefs and attendants, and in cylindrical wood altars dedicated to the human hand, which is worshipped in the Benin religion.

Ireland was dreary, oppressive, and bereft of hope; ravaged by nationwide inflation, endless public-sector strikes, high unemployment, and high emigration. Dublin&#x2019;s north inner city was the epicenter of Ireland&#x2019;s crisis. There the buildings were dirty and decrepit, with over 70 percent of the old Georgian tenements without hot running water, according to historical data. You could literally smell the abject poverty. Speaking at the launch of Combat Poverty&#x2019;s twentieth anniversary in 2007, Father Peter McVerry recalled that the tough inner-city area of Summerhill, for example, was &#x201c;crawling with rats&#x2014;rats the size of little kittens and immune from every poison ever invented. Parents would tell you of waking up in the morning and finding a rat on the baby&#x2019;s cot. Some blocks of flats had to share an outside toilet and the children had to be washed in the local Sean McDermott Street swimming pool, as they had no baths or showers.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was an era when the Catholic Church still exercised powerful influence on government policy and the lives of everyday people, particularly in terms of anything that concerned sexual morality. Sex before marriage was a sin and a social evil. Contraceptives were banned. Homosexuality was a crime. Divorce and abortion, also illegal. Even the slightest &#x201c;morally dubious&#x201d; reference found in the media, such as the imported feminist magazine <i>Spare Rib</i> showing women how to examine their breasts, was blue-penciled into oblivion as the Church and State sought to hold back the tide of liberalism surging in from Britain and America, and preserve and strengthen Catholic moral teaching in the Irish population, 90 percent of whom attended Mass every Sunday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the political struggle in the North was a continual presence in the news. Belfast was Baghdad. Walls and fences divided religious sects. Soldiers patrolled streets. People got tortured. Death piled upon death.</p> <p>In this period of social and economic crisis and sexual repression, many young people turned to hard drugs in an effort to escape. Coke and heroin replaced acid and hash on Dublin&#x2019;s inner-city streets, and plunged entire neighborhoods further into darkness. And the authorities didn&#x2019;t seem to care; that is until the spread of heroin led to an upsurge in property crime in more-affluent areas as users searched for ways to finance their next fix.</p> <p>Irish music struggled to find its voice amid the soul-destroying oppression in the South and the fatal bomb blasts in the North. There were very few venues or professional recording studios for the rock bands brave (or stupid) enough to make a noise, and no music press or rock radio existed for much of the decade. The smartly dressed show bands reigned supreme, and made a decent living performing their polite covers of contemporary pop hits and traditional country favorites. But their lack of ambition was crippling. Youth culture&#x2019;s only glimmer of light came from the outer world: <i>NME, Sounds,</i> pirate radio, and, at least in Dublin, the BBC, which broadcast <i>Top of the Pops</i> and <i>The Old Grey Whistle Test</i>. True, Ireland had whipped Thin Lizzy and Rory Gallagher into fighting shape, but they both had to move to London to get noticed. Ireland was a cultural backwater that drowned anyone who stayed there for too long.</p> <p>It was against this hopeless backdrop that a fourteen-year-old boy called Larry Mullen pinned a note on the bulletin board at Dublin&#x2019;s Mount Temple Comprehensive School looking for fellow students to form a rock-and-roll band. The note read: &#x201c;Money wasted on a drum kit. Anyone done the same on guitars?&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Lawrence (Larry) Joseph Mullen was born on October 31, 1961, in Artane, on the north side of Dublin. His namesake father was a civil servant at the Department of Health and Environment, having previously considered a life in the priesthood, and his mother, Maureen, was a housewife. He was the middle child of three, and the Mullens&#x2019; only son. Larry was a good-looking lad, but physically small and painfully shy around people he didn&#x2019;t know very well. At the age of nine, his parents thought it would be good for him to express himself through music and enrolled him in a piano course at the College of Music in Chatham Row, near St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. His teacher was, in his own words, &#x201c;a really nice lady,&#x201d; but within a few months she pulled him aside and told him that he was probably wasting his time learning the piano because his heart didn&#x2019;t seem to be in it. Larry agreed; he didn&#x2019;t practice much at home and hated studying the scales. But as he was leaving the college that day with his mother, he heard the sound of drums being played in an adjacent room. He immediately turned to her and said, &#x201c;You hear that? That&#x2019;s what I want to do.&#x201d; His mother agreed to let him, but only if he paid for the lessons himself. So Larry washed cars and mowed lawns until he had saved enough money to attend a weekly class at the college under the tutelage of Joe Bonnie, a veteran of the Irish theater world who specialized in military-style drumming. Larry instantly fell in love with the instrument, but again demonstrated little interest in going through the rudiments of music theory. The little drummer boy was far more interested in doing his own thing, which was tapping along on a drum pad to the music he heard when tuning in to Radio Luxembourg on his pocket radio or watching <i>Top of the Pops,</i> specifically glam rockers The Glitter Band, Sweet, and David Bowie.</p> <p>Tragedy befell the Mullen household when Larry&#x2019;s little sister, Mary, died in 1973. She was nine years old. Larry continued to attend the drum lessons, albeit halfheartedly and less frequently, until 1974 when Bonnie died of a heart attack and his more demanding daughter Monica inherited the class by default. Larry&#x2019;s father and older sister, Cecilia, rewarded him for sticking with the course for so long by buying him his first full drum kit (which was made by a Taiwanese toy company) for seventeen pounds.</p> <p>In many ways, Larry and his old man had a typical Irish father-son relationship. His father was a tough man, a disciplinarian, and Larry, subconsciously or otherwise, challenged his authority at almost every turn. His father was well educated and hardworking, and he expected his son to follow in his footsteps. But Larry showed little interest in school or education in general. However, father and son had at least one common bond: Gaelic football. Both were supporters of the Dubs and regularly attended games together at Croke Park, and it was there Larry first saw the Christian Brothers&#x2013;run Artane Boys&#x2019; Band, dressed in their distinctive blue-and-scarlet uniforms, entertaining the spectators at halftime. Before long, his father had signed him up to the junior marching band, but Larry left after just three days when the Brother in charge ordered him to chop off his shoulder-length golden locks&#x2014;Larry&#x2019;s pride and joy. Eventually, Larry settled on the Post Office Workers&#x2019; Union Band, which was a more relaxed outfit and afforded him the opportunity to goof around with friends. He spent two blissful years with them, playing in towns up and down the country.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1974, Larry joined Mount Temple Comprehensive School after failing the entrance exams to St. Paul&#x2019;s College and Chanel College. Mount Temple had opened its doors just two years earlier and held the distinction of being Dublin&#x2019;s first co-educational, multi-denominational school under Protestant management. It was considered a place that encouraged expression and individuality, free from the sexual, physical, and emotional abuse prevalent in the Catholic-run institutions. Here, it almost seemed as if the old world had died, and the new one was fighting to be born.</p> <p>Larry was well liked at Mount Temple, especially among the young ladies in his year. &#x201c;He was quiet but popular,&#x201d; recalls Janice Bearman, an ex-classmate. &#x201c;I must admit I did not see the attraction, but two of my friends were very taken with him and you were aware that Larry had a lot of female admirers, though he was modest and did not seem to be aware of it. If he was, it did not go to his head.&#x201d; One such admirer was a chatty, blond-haired girl called Ann Acheson, and soon she and Larry were spotted holding hands in the schoolyard.</p> <p>However, life at Mount Temple wasn&#x2019;t all blushing teenage girls and budding romance for Larry. Because he was quiet and short in stature, he was bullied by a number of older children. His bus ride home, for example, was often a bumpy one. Recalls a former pupil: &#x201c;We used to get a bus from school that went up Malahide Road and he used to get off at the roundabout in Artane, the same as us. I feel quite embarrassed about it now, but we used to give him a clip over the head. He&#x2019;d be sitting near the back and everyone who went by would just clatter the poor kid.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bruised head aside, Larry relished the relative freedom of Mount Temple, which in turn sparked an improvement in his schoolwork. He became particularly adept at maths and art. But the drums remained his true passion. Always the drums. And in September 1976&#x2014;at the suggestion of his father&#x2014;he plucked up the courage to put out a call on the school notice board for guitarists to join a new band. &#x201c;You are not going to get anywhere,&#x201d; Larry Senior told him, &#x201c;if you continue playing on your own.&#x201d; Although no one paid much attention to his ad to begin with, Larry was determined. He had heard Mount Temple&#x2019;s new arrival Adam Clayton was a mean bass player, and approached him in the schoolyard. &#x201c;I got so excited when I saw him,&#x201d; Larry said later, &#x201c;because he had bushy blond hair, he was wearing tinted glasses and a really long afghan coat. He looked so cool and I just said, &#x2018;I want to be in a band with him!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Adam Charles Clayton was born on March 13, 1960, in his grandparents&#x2019; home in the quaint English village of Chinnor in Oxfordshire. His father, Brian, was a pilot for the RAF, and his mother, Jo, was a rather glamorous-looking housewife and part-time air hostess. In 1964, the Clayton family&#x2014;Brian, Jo, Adam, and his younger sister, Sarah Jane&#x2014;upped sticks and moved to Nairobi when Brian landed a job with East African Airways. It was an incredible place to live: the heat, the smells, the servants. But within a year, the threat of ethnic violence amid a tribal conflict had become too great, and affluent white families were encouraged to leave. Brian promptly accepted an offer to work for the Irish airline Aer Lingus and the Claytons settled down in Malahide, a middle-class coastal town ten miles north of Dublin city. Another child, Sebastian, was born there.</p> <p>Adam attended St. Andrew&#x2019;s National School until he was eight, after which his parents enrolled him at the preparatory school Castle Park in south Dublin, where he boarded through the week. But Adam hated every minute of it. He was chubby, bespectacled, and allergic to every sporting activity outside of cricket, and from day one, he exhibited a total lack of interest in the value systems of getting a good education or working hard in a nine-to-five job. Adam&#x2019;s defense mechanism was to be the class clown and push the boundaries of what was acceptable in an antiquated schooling system. He was a rebel, but a charming rebel. He spoke with a posh English accent and was invariably polite and well mannered. Nevertheless, he often found himself hauled in front of the principal for being disruptive. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going to happen to you?&#x201d; the exasperated principal asked him one day. To which Adam replied: &#x201c;Well, sir, I&#x2019;m obviously going to be a comedian.&#x201d;</p> <p>Pop music and television were frowned upon at Castle Park, but Adam found a small window of escapism in the Gramophone Society, which got together twice a week to listen to classical music. An outgoing teacher also played him the soundtracks from Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x2019;s rock opera <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> and David Greene&#x2019;s screen adaptation of <i>Godspell</i> on an old tape recorder. This inspired him to experiment with piano lessons, but he soon gave them up when he realized that he had neither the hand coordination nor the discipline to do the instrument justice.</p> <p>At the age of thirteen, Adam was on the move again, to another boarding school in south Dublin, St. Columba&#x2019;s College. It was cold there, terribly cold. There was no heating throughout the old buildings, and the enormous dormitories housed around twenty-five to thirty shivering students. Adam shared a bunk bed with an English boy called John Leslie, and the two of them became close friends. &#x201c;I think it [St. Columba&#x2019;s] was a shock to both our systems,&#x201d; recalls Leslie, &#x201c;and we immediately hit it off. Adam was a much more outgoing character than I, and he was up to hijinks literally from the minute he hit the ground there. He was always up for a laugh in the nicest possible way. Never nasty.&#x201d;</p> <p>Adam and Leslie fell in love with classic rock in a big way when Leslie&#x2019;s brother in England began to ply them with cassette tapes of bands like the Grateful Dead, The Who, and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. Later, Adam persuaded his father to bring him back sacks full of tapes whenever he was on pilot duty in Singapore. Then he would make copies and sell them to other students to fund the purchase of cigarettes and alcohol. &#x201c;By the time Adam was fourteen or fifteen, he had the most enormous library of cassettes,&#x201d; says Leslie. &#x201c;He was absolutely riveted by rock music really from as soon as he and I could get our hands on it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Leslie had started playing guitar when he was around twelve, and spent hour after hour practicing in the music room to stave off the boredom of boarding school. Adam occasionally joined him on a secondhand acoustic guitar, and even took a few classical guitar lessons at the school. Eventually, Leslie sold him on the idea of picking up a bass guitar, saying that he thought it would be &#x201c;quite good craic to make some noise together.&#x201d; It was then that Adam formed a cunning plan and presented it to his parents: buy me a bass and my grades will improve. His parents took the bait and handed him fifty pounds to obtain his weapon of choice. &#x201c;I remember we went off down to McCullough Piggot&#x2019;s, which is a well-known music store in Dublin, but decided they were far too expensive,&#x201d; recalls Leslie. &#x201c;We ended up in a tiny little guitar shop to the left of Dame Street where we spied a brown Ibanez bass copy and that&#x2019;s the one he got. Then we just messed about. I didn&#x2019;t really teach him. Adam was a typical rock-and-roll bass player right from when he started in that he wasn&#x2019;t that much interested about playing it. What he was interested in was having a good time, and that&#x2019;s what he did!&#x201d;</p> <p>Indeed. Adam grew his hair, wore hippie clothes, and skipped classes. He was regularly put in detention.</p> <p>Soon the two friends roped in a young drummer called Paul Newenham and started fleshing out a rock musical Leslie had begun to write. &#x201c;I suppose loosely speaking we were a band, the three of us together,&#x201d; says Leslie. &#x201c;We rehearsed together in a place called the Concrete Sock, which was an old pig house in the farmyard that was attached to the school beyond the science block. That was our first attempt at playing with other people.&#x201d;</p> <p>But, alas, the trio&#x2019;s bid to become the heirs to Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x2019;s musical throne was cut short in the summer of 1976 when St. Columba&#x2019;s asked Adam to leave due to his awful grades and taste for the absurd.

STORIES: &#34;Silence Please&#34;; &#34;Big Game Hunt&#34;; &#34;Patent Pending&#34;; &#34;Armaments Race&#34;; &#34;Critical Mass&#34;; &#34;The Ultimate Melody&#34;; &#34;The Pacifist&#34;; &#34;The Next Tenants&#34;; &#34;Moving Spirit&#34;; &#34;The Man Who Ploughed the Sea&#34;; &#34;The Reluctant Orchid&#34;; &#34;Cold War&#34;; &#34;What Goes Up&#34;; &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34;; &#34;The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch.&#34; All these were written between 1950 and 1957.</p><p>You come upon the "White Hart" quite unexpectedly in one of these anonymous little lanes leading down from Fleet Street to the Embankment. It's no use telling you where it is: very few people who have set out in a determined effort to get there have actually arrived. For the first dozen visits a guide is essential: after that you'll probably be all right if you close your eyes and rely on instinct. Also--to be perfectly frank--we don't want any more customers, at least on our night. The place is already uncomfortably crowded. All that I'll say about its location is that it shakes occasionally with the vibration of newspaper presses, and that if you crane out of the window of the gent's room you can just see the Thames.<br><br>From the outside, it looks like any other pub--as indeed it is for five days of the week. The public and saloon bars are on the ground floor: there are the usual vistas of brown oak panelling and frosted glass, the bottles behind the bar, the handles of the beer engines ... nothing out of the ordinary at all. Indeed, the only concession to the twentieth century is the juke box in the public bar. It was installed during the war in a laughable attempt to make G.I.'s feel at home, and one of the first things we did was to make sure there was no danger of its ever working again.<br><br>At this point I had better explain who "we" are. That is not as easy as I thought it was going to be when I started, for a complete catalogue of the "White Hart's" clients would probably be impossible and would certainly be excruciatingly tedious. So all I'll say at this point is that "we" fall into three main classes. First there are the journalists, writers and editors. The journalists, of course, gravitated here from Fleet Street. Those who couldn't make the grade fled elsewhere: the tougher ones remained. As for the writers, most of them heard about us from other writers, came here for copy, and got trapped.<br><br>Where there are writers, of course, there are sooner or later editors. If Drew, our landlord, got a percentage on the literary business done in his bar, he'd be a rich man. (We suspect he is a rich man, anyway.) One of our wits once remarked that it was a common sight to see half a dozen indignant authors arguing with a hard-faced editor in one corner of the "White Hart," while in another, half a dozen indignant editors argued with a hard-faced author.<br><br>So much for the literary side: you will have, I'd better warn you, ample opportunities for close-ups later. Now let us glance briefly at the scientists. How did they get in here?<br><br>Well, Birkbeck College is only across the road, and King's is just a few hundred yards along the Strand. That's doubtless part of the explanation, and again personal recommendation had a lot to do with it. Also, many of our scientists are writers, and not a few of our writers are scientists. Confusing, but we like it that way.<br><br>The third portion of our little microcosm consists of what may be loosely termed "interested laymen." They were attracted to the "White Hart" by the general brouhaha, and enjoyed the conversation and company so much that they now come along regularly every Wednesday--which is the day when we all get together. Sometimes they can't stand the pace and fall by the wayside, but there's always a fresh supply.<br><br>With such potent ingredients, it is hardly surprising that Wednesday at the "White Hart" is seldom dull. Not only have some remarkable stories been told there, but remarkable things have happened there. For example, there was the time when Professor --, passing through on his way to Harwell, left behind a brief-case containing--well, we'd better not go into that, even though we did so at the time. And most interesting it was, too.... Any Russian agents will find me in the corner under the dartboard. I come high, but easy terms can be arranged.<br><br>Now that I've finally thought of the idea, it seems astonishing to me that none of my colleagues has ever got round to writing up these stories. Is it a question of being so close to the wood that they can't see the trees? Or is it lack of incentive? No, the last explanation can hardly hold: several of them are quite as hard up as I am, and have complained with equal bitterness about Drew's "NO CREDIT" rule. My only fear, as I type these words on my old Remington Noiseless, is that John Christopher or George Whitley or John Beynon are already hard at work using up the best material. Such as, for instance, the story of the Fenton Silencer....<br><br>I don't know when it began: one Wednesday is much like another and it's hard to tag dates on to them. Besides, people may spend a couple of months lost in the "White Hart" crowd before you first notice their existence. That had probably happened to Harry Purvis, because when I first came aware of him he already knew the names of most of the people in our crowd. Which is more than I do these days, now that I come to think of it.<br><br>But though I don't know when, I know exactly how it all started. Bert Huggins was the catalyst, or, to be more accurate, his voice was. Bert's voice would catalyse anything. When he indulges in a confidential whisper, it sounds like a sergeant major drilling an entire regiment. And when he lets himself go, conversation languishes elsewhere while we all wait for those cute little bones in the inner ear to resume their accustomed places.<br><br>He had just lost his temper with John Christopher (we all do this at some time or other) and the resulting detonation had disturbed the chess game in progress at the back of the saloon bar. As usual, the two players were surrounded by backseat drivers, and we all looked up with a start as Bert's blast whammed overhead. When the echoes died away, someone said: "I wish there was a way of shutting him up."<br><br>It was then that Harry Purvis replied: "There is, you know."<br><br>Not recognising the voice, I looked round. I saw a small, neatly-dressed man in the late thirties. He was smoking one of those carved German pipes that always makes me think of cuckoo clocks and the Black Forest. That was the only unconventional thing about him: otherwise he might have been a minor Treasury official all dressed up to go to a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee.<br><br>"I beg your pardon?" I said.<br><br>He took no notice, but made some delicate adjustments to his pipe. It was then that I noticed that it wasn't, as I'd thought at first glance, an elaborate piece of wood carving. It was something much more sophisticated--a contraption of metal and plastic like a small chemical engineering plant. There were even a couple of minute valves. My God, it was a chemical engineering plant....<br><br>I don't goggle any more easily than the next man, but I made no attempt to hide my curiosity. He gave me a superior smile.<br><br>"All for the cause of science. It's an idea of the Biophysics Lab. They want to find out exactly what there is in tobacco smoke--hence these filters. You know the old argument--does smoking cause cancer of the tongue, and if so, how? The trouble is that it takes an awful lot of--er--distillate to identify some of the obscurer bye-products. So we have to do a lot of smoking."<br><br>"Doesn't it spoil the pleasure to have all this plumbing in the way?"<br><br>"I don't know. You see, I'm just a volunteer. I don't smoke."<br><br>"Oh," I said. For the moment, that seemed the only reply. Then I remembered how the conversation had started.<br><br>"You were saying," I continued with some feeling, for there was still a slight tintinus in my left ear, "that there was some way of shutting up Bert. We'd all like to hear it--if that isn't mixing metaphors somewhat."<br><br>"I was thinking," he replied, after a couple of experimental sucks and blows, "of the ill-fated Fenton Silencer. A sad story--yet, I feel, one with an interesting lesson for us all. And one day--who knows?--someone may perfect it and earn the blessings of the world."<br><br>Suck, bubble, bubble, plop....<br><br>"Well, let's hear the story. When did it happen?"<br><br>He sighed.<br><br>"I'm almost sorry I mentioned it. Still, since you insist--and, of course, on the understanding that it doesn't go beyond these walls."<br><br>"Er--of course."<br><br>"Well, Rupert Fenton was one of our lab assistants. A very bright youngster, with a good mechanical background, but, naturally, not very well up in theory. He was always making gadgets in his spare time. Usually the idea was good, but as he was shaky on fundamentals the things hardly ever worked. That didn't seem to discourage him: I think he fancied himself as a latter-day Edison, and imagined he could make his fortune from the radio tubes and other oddments lying around the lab. As his tinkering didn't interfere with his work, no-one objected: indeed, the physics demonstrators did their best to encourage him, because, after all, there is something refreshing about any form of enthusiasm. But no-one expected he'd ever get very far, because I don't suppose he could even integrate e to the x."<br><br>"Is such ignorance possible?" gasped someone.<br><br>"Maybe I exaggerate. Let's say x e to the x. Anyway, all his knowledge was entirely practical--rule of thumb, you know. Give him a wiring diagram, however complicated, and he could make the apparatus for you. But unless it was something really simple, like a television set, he wouldn't understand how it worked. The trouble was, he didn't realise his limitations. And that, as you'll see, was most unfortunate.<br><br>"I think he must have got the idea while watching the Honours Physics students doing some experiments in acoustics. I take it, of course, that you all understand the phenomenon of interference?"<br><br>"Naturally," I replied.<br><br>"Hey!" said one of the chess-players, who had given up trying to concentrate on the game (probably because he was losing.) "I don't."<br><br>Purvis looked at him as though seeing something that had no right to be around in a world that had invented penicillin.<br><br>"In that case," he said coldly, "I suppose I had better do some explaining." He waved aside our indignant protests. "No, I insist. It's precisely those who don't understand these things who need to be told about them. If someone had only explained the theory to poor Fenton while there was still time...."<br><br>He looked down at the now thoroughly abashed chess-player.<br><br>"I do not know," he began, "if you have ever considered the nature of sound. Suffice to say that it consists of a series of waves moving through the air. Not, however, waves like those on the surface of the sea--oh dear no! Those waves are up and down movements. Sound waves consist of alternate compressions and rarefactions."<br>"Rare-what?"<br><br>"Rarefactions."<br><br>"Don't you mean 'rarefications'?"<br><br>"I do not. I doubt if such a word exists, and if it does, it shouldn't," retorted Purvis, with the aplomb of Sir Alan Herbert dropping a particularly revolting neologism into his killing-bottle. "Where was I? Explaining sound, of course. When we make any sort of noise, from the faintest whisper to that concussion that went past just now, a series of pressure changes moves through the air. Have you ever watched shunting engines at work on a siding? You see a perfect example of the same kind of thing. There's a long line of goods-wagons, all coupled together. One end gets a bang, the first two trucks move together--and then you can see the compression wave moving right along the line. Behind it the reverse thing happens--the rarefaction--I repeat, rarefaction--as the trucks separate again.<br><br>"Things are simple enough when there is only one source of sound--only one set of waves. But suppose you have two wave-patterns, moving in the same direction? That's when interference arises, and there are lots of pretty experiments in elementary physics to demonstrate it. All we need worry about here is the fact--which I think you will all agree is perfectly obvious--that if one could get two sets of waves exactly out of step, the total result would be precisely zero. The compression pulse of one sound wave would be on top of the rarefaction of another--net result--no change and hence no sound. To go back to my analogy of the line of wagons, it's as if you gave the last truck a jerk and a push simultaneously. Nothing at all would happen.<br><br>"Doubtless some of you will already see what I am driving at, and will appreciate the basic principle of the Fenton Silencer. Young Fenton, I imagine, argued in this manner. 'This world of ours,' he said to himself, 'is too full of noise. There would be a fortune for anyone who could invent a really perfect silencer. Now, what would that imply ...?'<br><br>"It didn't take him long to work out the answer: I told you he was a bright lad. There was really very little in his pilot model. It consisted of a microphone, a special amplifier, and a pair of loudspeakers. Any sound that happened to be about was picked up by the mike, amplified and inverted so that it was exactly out of phase with the original noise. Then it was pumped out of the speakers, the original wave and the new one cancelled out, and the net result was silence.<br><br>"Of course, there was rather more to it than that. There had to be an arrangement to make sure that the cancelling wave was just the right intensity--otherwise you might be worse off than when you started. But these are technical details that I won't bore you with. As many of you will recognise, it's a simple application of negative feed-back."<br><br>"Just a moment!" interrupted Eric Maine. Eric, I should mention, is an electronics expert and edits some television paper or other. He's also written a radio play about space-flight, but that's another story. "Just a moment! There's something wrong here. You couldn't get silence that way. It would be impossible to arrange the phase ..."<br><br>Purvis jammed the pipe back in his mouth. For a moment there was an ominous bubbling and I thought of the first act of "Macbeth." Then he fixed Eric with a glare.<br><br>"Are you suggesting," he said frigidly, "that this story is untrue?"<br><br>"Ah--well, I won't go as far as that, but ..." Eric's voice trailed away as if he had been silenced himself. He pulled an old envelope out of his pocket, together with an assortment of resistors and condensers that seemed to have got entangled in his handkerchief, and began to do some figuring. That was the last we heard from him for some time.<br><br>"As I was saying," continued Purvis calmly, "that's the way Fenton's Silencer worked. His first model wasn't very powerful, and it couldn't deal with very high or very low notes. The result was rather odd. When it was switched on, and someone tried to talk, you'd hear the two ends of the spectrum--a faint bat's squeak, and a kind of low rumble. But he soon got over that by using a more linear circuit (dammit, I can't help using some technicalities!) and in the later model he was able to produce complete silence over quite a large area. Not merely an ordinary room, but a full-sized hall. Yes....<br><br>"Now Fenton was not one of these secretive inventors who won't tell anyone what they are trying to do, in case their ideas are stolen. He was all too willing to talk. He discussed his ideas with the staff and with the students, whenever he could get anyone to listen. It so happened that one of the first people to whom he demonstrated his improved Silencer was a young Arts student called--I think--Kendall, who was taking Physics as a subsidiary subject. Kendall was much impressed by the Silencer, as well he might be. But he was not thinking, as you may have imagined, about its commercial possibilities, or the boon it would bring to the outraged ears of suffering humanity. Oh dear no! He had quite other ideas.<br><br>"Please permit me a slight digression.

You were Trump yesterday, you&#x2019;re Trump today, and barring some extraordinary intervention, you&#x2019;ll be Trump tomorrow.</p><p>There are, certainly, compensations to being Donald Trump. You&#x2019;re fabulously wealthy; you have a lifetime pass to help yourself to younger and younger wives, even as you get older and older&#x2014;a two-way Benjamin Button dynamic that is equal parts enviable and grotesque. You own homes in Manhattan; Palm Beach; upstate New York; Charlottesville, Virginia; and Rancho Palos Verdes, California; and you&#x2019;re free to bunk down in the penthouse suite of any hotel, apartment building, or resort that flies the Trump flag, anywhere on the planet&#x2014;and there are a lot of them.</p><p>But none of that changes the reality of waking up every morning, looking in the bathroom mirror, and seeing Donald Trump staring back at you. And no, it&#x2019;s not the hair; that, after all, is a choice&#x2014;one that may be hard for most people to understand, but a choice all the same, and there&#x2019;s a certain go-to-hell confidence in continuing to make it. The problem with being Trump is the same thing that explains the enormous fame and success of Trump: a naked neediness, a certain shamelessness, an insatiable hunger to be the largest, loudest, most honkingly conspicuous presence in any room&#x2014;the great, braying Trumpness of Trump&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s probably far less of a revel than it seems.</p><p>Contented people, well-grounded people, people at ease inside their skin, just don&#x2019;t behave the way Trump does. They go easy on the superlatives&#x2014;especially when they&#x2019;re talking about their own accomplishments. Maybe what they&#x2019;re building or selling really is the greatest, the grandest, the biggest, the most stupendous, but they let the product do the talking. If it can&#x2019;t, maybe it ain&#x2019;t so great. They use their own names sparingly, too&#x2014;even when they&#x2019;re businesspeople who have the opportunity to turn themselves from a person into a brand. There is no GatesWare software, no BezosBooks.com; it&#x2019;s not Zuckerbook you log on to a dozen times a day, it&#x2019;s Facebook. But the Trump name is everywhere in the Trump world&#x2014;on his buildings, on his helicopters, on the side of every single plane in the fleet that was once known as the Eastern Air Shuttle until Trump bought it in1989 and renamed it the Trump Shuttle. It&#x2019;s been on Trump Mortgage, Trump Financial, Trump Sales and Leasing, Trump Restaurants, Trump vodka, Trump chocolate, Donald Trump The Fragrance, Trump water, Trump home furnishings, Trump clothing, Trump Books, Trump Golf, Trump University and yes, Trump the Game.</p><p>There is presumption in the Trump persona, too&#x2014;in his attempt to trademark &#x201c;You&#x2019;re fired,&#x201d; after it became a catchphrase on The Apprentice, his top-rated reality show; in his offer to donate $5 million to a charity of President Obama&#x2019;s choosing if Obama would release to him, Trump, his college transcripts. There is petulance&#x2014;in his public feuds with Rosie O&#x2019;Donnell (&#x201c;A total loser&#x201d;), Seth Meyers (&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a stutterer&#x201d;), Robert De Niro (&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not dealing with Albert Einstein&#x201d;) and Arianna Huffington, (&#x201c;Unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man . . .&#x201d;).</p><p>There is, too, an almost&#x2014;almost&#x2014;endearing cluelessness to the primal way he signals his pride in himself. He poses for pictures with his suit jacket flaring open, his hands on his hips, index and ring fingers pointing inevitably groinward&#x2014;a great-ape fitness and genital display if ever there was one. After he bought the moribund Gulf+Western Building in New York City&#x2019;s Columbus Circle, skinned it down, covered it in gold-colored glass, converted it into a luxury hotel and residence, and reinforced it with steel and concrete to make it less subject to swaying in the wind, Trump boasted to The New York Times that it was going to be &#x201c;the stiffest building in the city.&#x201d; If he was aware of his own psychic subtext, he gave no indication.</p><p>Donald Trump the person was not always Donald Trump the phenomenon. He began his career in his father&#x2019;s company, building modestly priced rental properties in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, which is to the New York real estate world what Waffle House is to the high-end restaurant industry. He made his move into Manhattan in 1971, and while his interests and appetites were clearly, gaudily upscale, he was, in his own vainglorious way, something of a man of the people. When the city couldn&#x2019;t manage to get Wollman Rink in Central Park renovated on time, Trump offered to take the project over, got it done within months and gave the city change back from its original budget. Yes, the name Trump would forever appear in conspicuous all-caps on the retaining walls surrounding the rink, but a civic good guy deserves a little recognition, doesn&#x2019;t he? He was married to the same woman for fifteen years, they had three children together, and if the first of them was named, no surprise, Donald, well, what of it? We had two George Bushes and two John Adamses, didn&#x2019;t we? He was socially and politically moderate: pro-choice, troubled by the unregulated flow of money into political campaigns, a champion of universal health care. &#x201c;Our goal should be clear,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Our people are our greatest asset.&#x201d;</p><p>It is a matter of historical record that that Trump is no more, that a large, loud foghorn of a man has taken his place, a man whose business acumen is undeniable, but whose public persona has become, to many, unbearable. To call Donald Trump a narcissist is to state what seems clinically obvious. There is the egotism of narcissism, the grandiosity of narcissism, the social obtuseness of narcissism. He has his believers, yes. &#x201c;Love him or hate him, Trump is a man who is certain about what he wants, and sets out to get it, no holds barred,&#x201d; said one. &#x201c;Women find his power almost as much of a turn-on as his money.&#x201d; But it was Trump himself who spoke those admiring words, which makes them comical, sure, but troubling as well.</p><p>Trump may be an easy target, but he is also, in some ways, a sympathetic one. Narcissism isn&#x2019;t easy, it isn&#x2019;t fun, it isn&#x2019;t something to be waved off as a personal shortcoming that hurts only the narcissists themselves, any more than you can look at the drunk or philanderer or compulsive gambler and not see the grief and ruin in his future. Trump is unlikely to suffer such a fate, but it awaits plenty of other narcissists&#x2014;and increasingly, they seem to be everywhere.</p><p>Narcissists are corrupt public officials, and honest ones too; they are the criminals who fill the jail cells, and sometimes the police who put them there in the first place. They are in industry, in media, in finance, in show business. They are artists, designers, chefs, scholars. They are the people we work with and the people we work for; the people we love and the people we bed; the people we hire or marry or befriend, and soon want to fire or leave or unfriend. They are the people who love us&#x2014;until they betray us.</p><p>The very word narcissist&#x2014;once the stuff of Greek mythology and psychology texts&#x2014;has entered the cultural argot as a shorthand descriptor for all manner of unpleasant characters, and we recognize each of them. It&#x2019;s the windbag drinking buddy who can go on for an entire evening about himself and his work and his new car and new house, but whose eyes glaze over and whose mind wanders the moment you begin to talk about yourself. It&#x2019;s the mirror-gazing friend who insists on modeling every stitch of clothing she owns for you but never seems to notice&#x2014;or comment on&#x2014;whether you&#x2019;re wearing a new dress, a favorite business suit or a giant garbage bag. It&#x2019;s the bombastic relative who sucks the air out of Thanksgiving dinner, holding forth on politics from the pumpkin soup through the pumpkin pie and tolerating neither interruption nor contradiction. It&#x2019;s the lover who charms the pants off of you&#x2014;literally&#x2014;and never returns your calls after that.</p><p>Narcissists may be ubiquitous&#x2014;paradoxically commonplace given how exceptional they think they are&#x2014;showing up in every corner of our lives, but it&#x2019;s the famous ones, the ones with the biggest stages and the biggest soapboxes, we notice before we notice the ones closest to us. That makes sense, partly because they warrant close scrutiny given the kind of impact&#x2014;usually negative&#x2014;they can have, partly because there&#x2019;s a can&#x2019;t-look-away quality to their train-wreck behavior. And we&#x2019;ve had a lot to look at in the United States of late.</p><p>So we get Ted Cruz, the freshman senator from Texas, conducting a twenty-one-hour filibuster&#x2014;perhaps democracy&#x2019;s greatest &#x201c;Look at me!&#x201d; spectacle&#x2014;in 2013 to oppose a health care law he couldn&#x2019;t repeal, couldn&#x2019;t defund and wouldn&#x2019;t sit down quietly to try to amend and improve, because that would mean weeks and months of collaborative work in private rooms with no cameras rolling or headlines flashing, and where&#x2019;s the fun in that? So we get Marlin Stutzman, a back-bench congressman who helped engineer the two-and-a-half-week federal shutdown that followed Cruz&#x2019;s spectacle and who, when asked why he and the rest of his faction wouldn&#x2019;t back down despite the cost to the nation, answered, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don&#x2019;t know what that even is.&#x201d; Because when 800,000 federal employees aren&#x2019;t allowed to go to work, when food inspections are being canceled, when the country is losing over $1.5 billion a day, what really counts is whether the politicians themselves are feeling the love.</p><p>So we get New Jersey governor Chris Christie, longtime political bullyboy, on whose watch the entire town of Fort Lee, New Jersey, suffered through four days of gridlock when most of its access to the George Washington Bridge was cut off, an act of professional payback after the town&#x2019;s Democratic mayor declined to cross party lines and endorse Christie in a reelection bid he was certain to win by a landslide anyway. Christie&#x2019;s marathon 109-minute press conference after the story broke was less mea culpa than personal lamentation, a catalogue of the ways he&#x2019;d suffered as a result of the incident.</p><p>&#x201c;I am a very sad person today,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the emotion I feel. A person close to me betrayed me. . . . I probably will get angry at some point, but I got to tell you the truth, I&#x2019;m sad.&#x201d; Christie also shared that he hadn&#x2019;t been sleeping well as a result of the scandal and that he felt &#x201c;humiliated&#x201d; and &#x201c;blindsided&#x201d; and found it &#x201c;incredibly disappointing to have people let [him] down this way.&#x201d; The Washington Post ran a word count on Christie&#x2019;s first-person references in the course of his long, on-camera ramble and reported 692 uses of I; 217 repetitions of me, my or mine; and 186 uses of I&#x2019;m or I&#x2019;ve. Thousands and thousands of Fort Lee residents suffered, but the big story to Chris Christie was, apparently, Chris Christie&#x2014;and that hurt him badly. &#x201c;I had a donor say well &#x2018;Who gives a shit about you?&#x2019; &#x201d; said one GOP finance official, according to Politico.com. &#x201c;What about all the people who are stuck on the bridge?&#x201d;</p><p>We have had, too, Miley Cyrus, who from childhood never had to look far for a camera or an audience, because she was practically born with them in front of her. Her twerking and grinding and stroking herself with a foam-rubber finger in a live TV performance left critics and fans slack-jawed. Most people concluded her performance was an effort to demonstrate to her fans that she had, you know, grown up and was, you know, no longer a child&#x2014;a rite of passage as inevitable for her as for anyone else, but somehow newsworthy because it was happening to Miley. This played out in the same summer that Lady Gaga&#x2014;she of the meat dress, which may or may not have had much fashion merit, but undeniably drew eyeballs&#x2014;released a song called &#x201c;Applause,&#x201d; in which she repeats over and over the lyric &#x201c;I live for the applause, applause, applause,&#x201d; as frank an admission and as powerful an anthem of the age of narcissism as you could imagine.</p><p>There is Bernie Madoff as well, a man whose multi-decade Ponzi scheme made him exceedingly rich, but at the cost of $65 billion in other people&#x2019;s wealth, stolen from a victim list that, in the government&#x2019;s records, ran 165 pages long. Hedge funds and banks made up much of that inventory of the wronged&#x2014;admittedly, nobody&#x2019;s idea of sympathetic victims&#x2014;but there were also pension funds and charities, as well as individuals like Jack Cutter of Longmont, Colorado, a seventy-nine-year-old oil industry worker who was living with his wife on $1 million in retirement savings, a nest egg that vanished in Madoff&#x2019;s care, forcing Cutter to take a job stocking supermarket shelves. Madoff may not have known Cutter, but he did know there would be hundreds or thousands of other Cutters among his victims&#x2014;indeed, his scheme depended on that fact&#x2014;and every morning he could nonetheless get out of bed and say, &#x201c;Yes, this is all right, these are good decisions.&#x201d;</p><p>Narcissists are the vanity presidential candidates&#x2014;the likes of Herman Cain and H. Ross Perot, people with more money and name recognition than governing skills, but who fancy themselves up to the task of being the most powerful person on earth because, well, how could they not be? It doesn&#x2019;t even require wealth to go on that &#x201c;Vote for me or at least pay attention to me&#x201d; ride. Did anybody believe Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich had any chance at all of ever taking the oath of office&#x2014;did they even believe it themselves?&#x2014;or was it just the naked craving to be on the presidential stage? In 2000, Ralph Nader ran quixotically for president on the Green Party ticket, winning 2.8 million votes nationwide&#x2014;and 97,488 of them in Florida, the large majority of which surely came out of Al Gore&#x2019;s hide. That Florida haul would have been more than enough to overcome the paper-thin 537 votes by which Gore lost the state to George W. Bush and, ultimately, the presidency. Yet when Nader was asked afterward if he felt like he had cost Gore the election, his answer was succinct: &#x201c;I think that Al Gore cost me the election.&#x201d;</p><p>Narcissists are athletes, too, and if anything, they&#x2019;re worse than the politicians, since they don&#x2019;t even have to affect humility, freeing them up to enjoy their posses and their bling and their SUVs, and to indulge in their magisterial habit of referring to themselves in the third person because, apparently, a mere pronoun is so unsatisfying when you have the opportunity to speak your own name aloud. &#x201c;I wanted to do what was best for, you know, LeBron James, and what LeBron James was gonna do to make him happy,&#x201d; said, well, LeBron James about his 2010 decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat&#x2014;or, as he put it, &#x201c;to take my talents to South Beach.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t sign me, sorry, but I must go.

After extensive research, however, Malcolm Stewart found that it has extraordinary mathematical properties, suggesting that it may be no less than the source of the number system used when ancient humanity first built cities.</p><p>Malcolm Stewart has had a varied career: priest, singer-songwriter, publisher&#39;s editor and book jacket designer, cartoonist, BBC and ITV producer, traveller, UN project coordinator, NGO relief-aid and refugee organiser, freelance artist and stained glass designer, lecturer and writer. He is 70, has five children and lives with his wife in Surrey.'I remain in awe of this book. Patterns of Eternity is probably the single most important addition to the body of sacred geometry to re-emerge in a decade. Malcolm Stewart's expose of this deceptively simple device will have scholars of art, architecture, mathematics and geometry entranced for centuries to come. 'More importantly, perhaps, it will stimulate thinking and geometrical playfulness among those who design our public buildings, gardens and futures, for what it points at is an elemental master diagram from which the building blocks of harmony and proportion are born, seemingly without effort, almost a short cut to the very principles which the modern world sorely needs to effect its eventual successful remodernisation. A seminal book.' -- John Martineau 'This illustrated, intellectual adventure brings sacred geometry to life.' -- Stephen Gawtry, The Bookseller Buyers' Guide '... beautiful and profound book... The author takes the reader on a cultural adventure from Pythagoras to the Pyramids, from the Vedic fire altar to Chinese shamanism, from Sufism to Raphael. All of this is beautifully illustrated with both diagrams and photographs, so that the reader is able to understand the subtleties of the geometric patters as well and the way in which they could be put into practice' -- Scientific &amp; Medical Network Review, Winter 2009/10 'Our understanding of sacred geometry takes a new leap with Malcolm Stewart's analysis of the so-called Starcut diagram in his landmark book Patterns of Eternity... Euclid, Plato and Pythagoras would surely approve of Stewart's profound and original work.' -- Nexus New Times, April-May 2010 'Well illustrated, with many useful diagrams. If you are entranced by the magic of numbers, this could well be of interest' -- Northern Earth, Spring 2010 'Malcolm Stewart's book "Patterns of Eternity" is a work of scholarship. Moreover, his writing style belies the depth of his knowledge and never intrudes upon the reader to the extent that it ever becomes boring. He is consistently interesting and all that he examines is so copiously illustrated that even I can follow the process.' -- Everything &amp; Nothing, January 2011</p><h2>Colt, an American legend: The official history of Colt firearms from 1836 to the present</h2><p>The official history of Colt firearms from 1836 to the present</p><p><b>R. L. Wilson</b> has authored more than forty books and more than three hundred articles in a career that has spanned four decades. His dedication to the world of arms and armor began with a boyhood in Minnesota, followed by internships at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Armouries, H.M. Tower of London, and the Wadsworth Atheneum, where he was appointed curator of firearms at the age of twenty-three.<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br> <br>The firearm has been a major tool in shaping history since the first effective gonnes&#x201d; of the fourteenth century, and no name in the history of unmaking can surpass the magical Colt. From their first proving grounds in frontier Texas and Florida in 1837 to the target ranges and collectors&#x2019; cabinets of the present, Colt arms have captivated millions of hunters, shooters, and collectors. Mechanically ingenious while most often simple and functional, these arms have nearly always possessed the lines and form of sculpture. To the delight of the pro and novice alike, a fraction of the production has the added feature of hand embellishments engraving, gold inlaying, carved or checkered stocks, platings in gold and silver, and rich casings. Presentation inscriptions, one of the most choice appointments, have set a fraction of this already desirable group into a still higher category of rarity and desirability.<br> <br>The firm that Sam Colt founded in 1836 is the oldest manufacturer of repeating firearms in the world and possessor of one of history&#x2019;s most respected brand names. Colt is to firearms as Kodak is to the camera, Ferrari to the automobile, and Singer to the sewing machine.<br> <br> <i>Colt: An American Legend</i> celebrates the Colt name, past and present, in a pictorial presentation of the plain and the fancy, the historic and the conventional a collection impossible for <i>any</i> enthusiast to assemble in today&#x2019;s incredible collecting market. Firearms by Colt are often considered the blue chips of gun collecting, and this study substantiates that opinion. Many specimens are in museum arms collections, or in private hands from which they are destined to pass to museums. Only in <i>Colt: An American Legend</i> have all these select guns and information about them been gathered together.<br> <br>The splendor of Sid Latham&#x2019;s photography has aimed to capture the artistic and mechanical excellence of the arms, while original period prints and photos have been selected to convey the unique historical ambience of the Colt company and its array of shooting irons.<br> <br>The author is indebted to Board Chairman George A. Strichman of Colt Industries, to Bob Abrams and his staff at Abbeville Press, and to the many collectors and museums who have shared their prized Colts with Sid Latham&#x2019;s lens to make <i>Colt: An American Legend</i> a reality.<br> <br>R.L.

At the heart of his work is the ongoing Newford series, of which this is the latest volume.<br><br>The city of Newford could be any contemporary North American city . . . except that magic lurks in its music, in its art, in the shadows of its grittiest streets, where mythic beings walk disguised. And its people are like you and me, each looking for a bit of magic to shape their lives and transform their fate. <br><br>Now, in this latest volume, we meet a bluesman hiding from the devil; a Buffalo Man at the edge of death; a murderous ghost looking for revenge; a wolf man on his first blind date; and many more. We're reunited with Jilly, Geordie, Sophie, the Crow Girls, and other characters whose lives have become part of the great Newford myth. And De Lint takes us beyond Newford's streets to the pastoral hills north of the city, where magic and music have a flavor different but powerful still.<br><br></p><p><i>Tapping the Dream Tree</i> collects 18 stories by bestselling contemporary fantasy master Charles de Lint. One story, "The Witching Hour," is original to this volume, with a few others taken from limited-edition chapbooks; the remaining tales have been drawn from an impressive diversity of magazines and anthologies. The stories are set in and around de Lint's mythic, haunted American city of Newford, and fans will recognize several characters from de Lint's popular series.<p>The powerful story "Ten for The Devil" is a superb choice for an opener: it showcases de Lint's literary strengths and treats of his recurring themes of magic, music, creativity, and human worth. Musician Staley Cross's grandmother has always warned her to be careful when she plays her blue fiddle. But Staley never quite believed that her music could rouse dangerous magic... until one night, playing in a faraway field, she discovers the Devil doesn't only go down to Georgia. First published before the filming of <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>, "Ten for the Devil" draws upon the same crossroads myth as does the movie, but takes a very different road as it follows Staley's search for her only hope of soul survival: a mysterious bluesman known as Robert. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p>Praise for Charles De Lint</p><p>"Triumphant!" -<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) on <i>The Onion Girl</i></p><p>"De Lint is a romantic; he believes in the great things, faith, hope, and charity (especially if love is included in that last), but he also believes in the power of magic-or at least the magic of fiction-to open our eyes to a larger world." -<i>Edmonton Journal</i></p><p>"De Lint is a master of the modern urban folktale." -<i>The Denver Post</i></p><p>"A master storyteller, De Lint blends Celtic, Native American, and other cultures into a seamless mythology that resonates with magic and truth."-<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"What makes De Lint's particular brand of fantasy so catchy is his attention to the ordinary. Like great writers of magic realism, he writes about people in the world we know, encountering magic as part of that world." -<i>Booklist</i></p></p><h2>Little Wilson and Big God (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>These are Anthony Burgess&#39;s candid confessions: he was seduced at the age of nine by an older woman; whilst serving in Gibraltar in World War II he was thrown into jail on VE Day for calling Franco names; he once taught a group of Nazi socialites that the English equivalent of &#39;heil&#39; was &#39;sod&#39; and had them crying &#39;Sod Hitler&#39;. Little Wilson and Big God moves from Moss Side to Malaya recalling Burgess&#39;s time as an education officer in the tropics, his tempestuous first marriage, his struggles with Catholicism and the beginning of his prolific writing life.

Includes a map of Asia and photos of US, British, and Soviet players in the region. Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Karl E. Meyer has taught at Princeton, Yale, and Tufts Universities.Meyer, editor of World Policy Journal and a longtime member of the New York Times editorial board, draws on his extensive knowledge to trace the histories of several south, central and west Asian countries that are now of critical importance to the U.S. At a time when powerless nations can have profound impact on international affairs, his work serves as a powerful introduction to this poorly understood region-valued for its oil and location yet feared for its extremism-and simultaneously offers instructive lessons to American policy makers as the U.S. forges relationships with these states. Meyer combines scholarly expertise with journalistic detail in a rich account relaying formative events through extensive research and poignant personal anecdotes. Skillfully weaving in his perceptive reflections on American imperialism, Meyer strongly argues, "Washington is the seat of an empire, if of a special kind," which must cultivate substantive relationships rather than shortsighted alliances if it hopes to win the war on terror. But Meyer's treatment of the countries under discussion is inconsistent. In some cases, he offers a succinct summary of relevant political events, whereas other histories are more arbitrary and less structured. A work of such scope also has little room for nuances. Together, these characteristics may leave readers with superficial understanding. However, Meyer intends to "sharpen" the reader's appetite, and interested readers will take the book for what it is-a compelling yet cursory introduction to a fascinating region-and continue to build a deeper understanding of the region. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Romans</h2><p>16 Discussions for Group Bible Study.</p><p></p><h2>The Devil Wears Prada</h2><p>A delightfully dishy novel about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses. <br><br>Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job &#x201c;a million girls would die for.&#x201d; Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of <i>Runway </i>magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts <i>Prada! Armani! Versace!</i> at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. <br><br>THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about &#x201c;The Boss from Hell.&#x201d; Narrated in Andrea&#x2019;s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda&#x2019;s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day&#x2014;and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.</p><p>It's a killer title: <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>. And it's killer material: author Lauren Weisberger did a stint as assistant to Anna Wintour, the all-powerful editor of <i>Vogue</i> magazine. Now she's written a book, and this is its theme: narrator Andrea Sachs goes to work for Miranda Priestly, the all-powerful editor of <i>Runway</i> magazine. Turns out Miranda is quite the bossyboots. That's pretty much the extent of the novel, but it's plenty. Miranda's behavior is so insanely over-the-top that it's a gas to see what she'll do next, and to try to guess which incidents were culled from the real-life antics of the woman who's been called Anna "Nuclear" Wintour. For instance, when Miranda goes to Paris for the collections, Andrea receives a call back at the New York office (where, incidentally, she's not allowed to leave her desk to eat or go to the bathroom, lest her boss should call). Miranda bellows over the line: "I am standing in the pouring rain on the <i>rue de Rivoli</i> and my driver has vanished. Vanished! Find him immediately!" <p> This kind of thing is delicious fun to read about, though not as well written as its obvious antecedent, <i>The Nanny Diaries</i>. And therein lies the essential problem of the book. Andrea's goal in life is to work for <i>The New Yorker</i>--she's only sticking it out with Miranda for a job recommendation. But author Weisberger is such an inept, ungrammatical writer, you're positively rooting for her fictional alter ego not to get anywhere near <i>The New Yorker</i>. Still, Weisberger has certainly one-upped <i>Me Times Three</i> author Alex Witchel, whose magazine-world novel never gave us the inside dope that was the book's whole <i>raison d' etre</i>. For the most part, <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> focuses on the outrageous Miranda Priestly, and she's an irresistible spectacle. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>"[A] funny, biting, low-cal treat."<br>-Rush &amp; Molloy, <i>The New York Daily News</i><br><br>"A deliciously witty and gossipy first novel."<br>-<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"[An] on-the-money kiss-and-tell debut.<br><i>-Kirkus</i></p><h2>In the Fullness of Time: A Historian Looks at Christmas, Easter, and the Early Church</h2><p>This engaging and beautifully written narrative sheds a brilliant new light on the life of Jesus and the courageous men and women who carried His message throughout a hostile empire.

In Amsterdam, in the summer of 1942, the Nazis forced teenager Anne Frank and her family into hiding. For over two years, they, another family and a German dentist lived in a &#39;secret annexe&#39;, fearing discovery. All that time, Anne kept a diary. An intimate record of tension and struggle, adolescence and confinement, anger and heartbreak, this is the definitive edition of the diary of Anne Frank.</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>The diary as Anne Frank wrote it. At last, in a new translation, this definitive edition contains entries about Anne's burgeoning sexuality and confrontations with her mother that were cut from previous editions. Anne Frank's <i>The Diary Of A Young Girl</i> is among the most enduring documents of the twentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has been a beloved and deeply admired monument to the indestructible nature of the human spirit, read by millions of people and translated into more than fifty-five languages. Doubleday, which published the first English translation of the diary in 1952, now offers a new translation that captures Anne's youthful spirit and restores the original material omitted by Anne's father, Otto -- approximately thirty percent of the diary. The elder Frank excised details about Anne's emerging sexuality, and about the often-stormy relations between Anne and her mother. Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupation forces, hid in the back of an Amsterdam office building for two years. This is Anne's record of that time. She was thirteen when the family went into the "Secret Annex," and in these pages, she grows to be a young woman and proves to be an insightful observer of human nature as well. A timeless story discovered by each new generation, <i>The Diary Of A Young Girl</i> stands without peer. For young readers and adults, it continues to bring to life this young woman, who for a time survived the worst horrors the modern world had seen -- and who remained triumphantly and heartbreakingly human throughout her ordeal.</p><h2>Eloise&#39;s Christmas Trinkles</h2><p>Eloise Loves Christmas, and she&#39;s spreading holiday cheer all over The Plaza Hotel.

This is the story of that terrible night, the air raid intended to be the climax of Sir Arthur &#39;Bomber&#39; Harris&#39;s relentless campaign to defeat Nazi Germany. 795 aircraft set out, nearly 700 men did not return. Piecing together the dramatic stories of these young fliers - the fledgling crews and the veterans, the survivors and the fallen, former RAF Flight Lieutenant John Nichol has interviewed the few surviving veterans, British and German, in the air and on the ground, to record the voices of a diminishing generation. While the airmen of Bomber Command were among the greatest heroes of the conflict, their contribution and sacrifice has, until recently, been sidelined in the face of post-war criticism of Bomber Command&#39;s tactics. Yet they were among the best of their generation. John Nichol&#39;s dramatic tribute to the men who flew on the RAF&#39;s bloodiest raid has provided the surviving veterans with the chance to tell the story of that terrible night - the night they flew to Nuremberg.</p><p>John Nichol is a former RAF flight lieutenant whose Tornado bomber was shot down on a mission over Iraq during the first Gulf War in 1991.

DJ is a self-sufficient young woman who holds an afterschool job grooming horses, sweeping stables, and teaching younger equestrians in exchange for riding time. Because of her concern with paying back her grandmother for special jumping lessons, she and her friend Amy advertize that they will bring a pony to birthday parties to offer children rides.

In the tradition of Matthew Arnold and Edmund Wilson, James Wood reads literature expansively, always pursuing its role and destiny in our lives. In a series of essays about such figures as Melville, Flaubert, Chekhov, Virginia Woolf, and Don DeLillo, Wood relates their fiction to questions of religious and philosophical belief. He suggests that the steady ebb of the sea of faith has much to do with the revo-<br>lutionary power of the novel, as it has developed over the last two centuries. To read James Wood is to be shocked into both thinking and feeling how great our debt to the novel is.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grand tradition of criticism, Wood's work is both commentary and literature in its own right--fiercely written, polemical, and richly poetic in style. This book marks the debut of a masterly literary voice.</p><p>For James Wood, great fiction is always a venture into danger--a journey to the farthest shores. By extension, great criticism too should demand and risk all. And his first collection, <i>The Broken Estate</i>, does so again and again. Since Wood graduated from Cambridge in the 1980s and began reviewing for <i>The Guardian</i>, his name has been preceded by phrases such as <i>enfant terrible</i> and followed by adjectives such as <i>fierce</i>, <i>fearless</i>, and occasionally far worse. Few critics have such an urgent relation to their reading, and it is this, combined with his all-encompassing intellect and verbal velvet, that makes Wood so terrifying--and so tender.<p> In his introduction to <i>The Broken Estate</i> he writes, "The gentle <i>request</i> to believe is what makes fiction so moving" (<i>gentle</i>, as both adjective and verb, and its adverbial form, seem key terms), and this is what Wood is drawn to explore in the Russian greats and the English, European, and American moderns, among others. Many of these essays originally appeared in the <i>London Review of Books</i> and <i>The New Republic</i>, where he is a senior editor, but his book is far from a bundle of accident. Wood's contention is that in the mid-19th century, the "distinctions between literary belief and religious belief" began to blur (or, depending on the writer, shimmer), causing a crisis for the likes of Melville, Gogol, and Flaubert, and leading to "a skepticism toward the real as we encounter it in the narrative." I suspect, however, that some will head straight for the pieces on their literary loves and not be so concerned with Wood's overarching thesis, at least initially. No matter. Each essay also stands on its own, whether the author is positing Jane Austen as "a ferocious innovator" more radical than Flaubert, Melville as the ultimate linguistic spendthrift, or Gogol as "a defensive fantasist."</p><p> In a brilliant take on Virginia Woolf--Wood makes even the much-discussed new--he declares (admits?) that "the writer-critic, wanting to be both faithful critic and original writer," is caught "in a flurry of trapped loyalties." But he himself almost always works his way out of such snares, one of the many joys of this book. In his analysis of the several sides of Thomas More, for example, Wood first reads <i>Utopia</i> as a comedy but then suggests we read it "more tragically--not as a Lucianic satire but as a darkly ironic vision of the impossible." The aphorisms and aper�us come thick and strong. (Keepers of commonplace books should start a separate volume just for Wood.) For example, "Leslie Stephen acted like a genius but he thought like a merely gifted man." Or, "Hemingway has a reputation as a cold master of repetition, an icicle formed from the drip of style, while Lawrence is most often seen as a hothead who fell over himself, verbally." And he also has a gift for the telling domestic detail: Gogol "irritated others by playing card games he had invented and then changing the rules during play. He became rather selfishly involved with undercooked macaroni cheese, a dish he made again and again for guests." But Wood will dislike being complimented on his sentences as much as he claims Woolf did. His art, too, must be measured in chapters.</p><p> Wood is a great lover, and this makes him if not a great hater then one who gets hot under the critical collar, his ardor turning to irritation and intemperance in pieces on Morrison, Pynchon, and Murdoch. But in his finest discussions--among them one on Chekhov and another on late-20th-century treasure W.G. Sebald--he instantly quickens writers, books, and readers into being. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"In America, where he now makes his home, consensus is building that James Wood, a thirty-four-year-old English-man, is the best literary critic of his generation. . . . Wood is not just a keen critic, our best, but a superb writer. James Wood is the kind of writer James Wood admires most: daring, meaty, boldly metaphoric and unequivocally committed."--Adam Begley, Financial Times<p>"After finishing one of James Wood's essays, I always feel that I have been in the company of a man who reads more perspicaciously and writes more incisively than almost anyone producing criticism today. His ability to transform complex, anxious thought into lucid, exciting prose is everywhere present in this wonderful book, as is an atmos-phere of civility, good sense, and justice."--Janet Malcolm</p><p>"In these essays a very bold intelligence illuminates literature and culture with a dashing fluency."--Elizabeth Hardwick</p><p>"In a distinctively impassioned voice, James Wood advances some formidable arguments for what fiction and the truthful deployment of the imagination can be. He is one of literature's true lovers, and his deeply felt, contentious essays are thrilling in their reach and moral seriousness."--Susan Sontag</p><p>"He is a true critic: an urgent, impassioned reader of literature, a tireless interpreter, a live and learned intelligence, good writing company. He has adopted the essay as his own; he uses it to write, in a way the serious writer does. That's to say, he drives his ideas hard; he hungers for metaphor . . . learned . . . cunningly brilliant."--Malcolm Bradbury, The New Statesman</p><p>"A book that makes you feel, having closed it, as if your mind has been oxygenated. While most reviewers tend to fall back on preconceived notions of good style, based mainly on their desire not to be challenged by fiction, Wood stands out for his desire to re-mint critical thought. He has the capacity to alert you all over again to the wonder of a single cadence, pulled out of the heart of a novel. He also forces you to reconsider what it is we mean when we say that a novel is real, is true, is great. There is no more, really, that we can ask of a critic."--Natasha Walter, The Independent on Sunday</p><p>"In this climate, James Wood's book is not just a pleasure in itself but a sign that things do not always necessarily go downhill. . . . 'Serious' books on literature and belief abound, but we have very few critics who can vie with Jarrell and Toynbee, who can remind us that talking about literature is a part of what literature is about, and talking about it with passion, precision, and out of a rich store of reading is a rare and precious gift: it is good for all of us that James Wood has it and we have James Wood."--Gabriel Josipovici, Times Literary Supplement</p><p>"James Wood has been called our best young critic. This is not true. He is our best critic; he thinks with a sublime ferocity. To enter Wood's mind is to cross a threshold: from the reviewer commonplaces that often pass for essay-writing into the intellectual daring that portends literary permanence. He is, for the moment, our Hazlitt. He may become something more."--Cynthia Ozick</p><p>"James Wood is an authentic literary critic, very rare in this bad time."--Harold Bloom</p></p><h2>J.

The burden was always on Soviet Russia to catch up&#x2014;enough to achieve a number of remarkable &#x201c;firsts&#x201d; in these years, from the first national rocket society to the first comprehensive surveys of spaceflight.

Anne Rice, right? Well, I had the opportunity of a lifetime to do just that two years ago for the publication of SERVANT OF THE BONES. We met in Miami, where she was doing a booksigning for several thousand fans at Books &amp; Books, right in the heart of South Beach. <br><br>The evening started with a grand parade, complete with a marching band and Anne as the leader of this procession, which ended in front of the store. Nevermind that it was 80-90 degrees outside, Anne dressed to the nines with a black crushed velvet vest and skirt, a long-sleeved poet's blouse, and a gold chain-link headpiece (This outfit was in keeping with the Babylonian mood of her book, SERVANT OF THE BONES). She was right in step with the rest of the crowd, all of whom were in full costume. <br><br>People started waiting in line for the Anne Rice signing early in the morning, so you can imagine what the line looked like by the time we arrived around 6PM. The store provided entertainment and refreshments, so everyone was quite good-natured about the wait. In fact, many people forged new friendships while waiting to meet Anne. Others took the time in line to read her book. By the time they reached the front of the line, they were full of questions for her about her new novel.<br><br>The costumes were amazing. One highlight was a male fan who dressed up as a futuristic super-vixon. He asked Anne if he could lie across the length of the booksigning table and have his picture taken with her. Being the great sport that she is, she said "sure." This bizarre moment was captured on the local news later that evening.<br><br>I must say that after spending the evening with Anne, I admired her all the more. She spent over 7 hours signing books and didn't take one break during the entire time! Her only wants were a few cans of cold TAB, a plentiful supply of well-inked pens, and cough drops. She took the time to speak with every single person whose book she signed that night, and you could tell how much this meant to her fans. <br><br>So, if you ever have the opportunity to attend an Anne Rice signing, GO! It's worth the wait, especially if you are lucky enough to catch her on Halloween.</p><h2>My First Alphabet Book (Leapfrog)</h2><p>LeapFrog and Scholastic have teamed up to create innovative and engaging learning books for children ages 0-6!<br><br>With touch-and-feel elements, pop-ups, and pull-tabs on every page, this interactive book featuring LeapFrog characters gives preschoolers a multi-sensory way to learn the alphabet!<br><br>On the left hand side of the last spread, there is a search-and-find game.

From 1929 to 1932, the two lived together in Paris, first as teacher and student, and later as lovers. Historically, Miller has been described as Man Ray&#x2019;s muse, but Partners in Surrealism reveals how their brief, mercurial love affair was a key source of mutual and sustained inspiration, resulting in some of the most powerful work of each artist&#x2019;s career. Featuring a candid and poignant contribution from Antony Penrose, the son of Miller and the English painter Roland Penrose, on the relationship between Man Ray and his parents in later years, this is an extraordinary exploration of the love, lust and desire that drove the art of the Surrealists.</p><p>Lynda Roscoe Hartigan is Chief Curator at the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Massachusetts.<br><br>Antony Penrose is Director of the Lee Miller Archives and the Penrose Collection.<br><br>Phillip Prodger is Curator of Photography at the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Massachusetts.A brilliant exploration of how two individuals, through mutual inspiration, helped shift the parameters of modern art and photography. &#x2014; <i>Amateur Photographer</i><br><br>Man Ray | Lee Miller: Partners in Surrealism... is a beautiful coffee table book...

Like another superstar who preceded him, Albert Einstein, Feynman's science was ahead of his time, but it was his qualities as a human being that caught the imaginations of ordinary people. A whole body of legend has grown up around the man--much of it promulgated by Feynman himself--and nearly 10 years after his death he remains a popular subject of memoirs, biographies, and even films. In <i>Richard Feynman</i>, respected science writers John and Mary Gribbins combine biography with popular science in this absorbing look at the great man's life and work. <p> Though there's little new information about Feynman's personal life and interests here--everything from his passion for bongo drums to his fascination with the country of Tuva has been documented many times and in many places before now--the Gribbons do an exemplary job of explaining just why Feyman was such a giant among physicists. Quanatum theory is the kind of subject that could give the average reader a raging headache, yet the Gribbons explain it so well that by the end of <i>Richard Feynman</i> even the most non-scientific among us will be able to appreciate just what a singular contribution to our world this science superstar made.</p><p>John Gribbin, Ph.D., trained as an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge before becoming a full-time science writer.

"Red Mike" Edson became a national hero on Guadalcanal during WW II for his epic defense of Henderson Field as the head of the 1st Marine Raider Battalion. He sustained his reputation for fearlessness on Tarawa, Saipan and Tinian as a regimental commander, then as assistant commander of the 2nd Marine Division. In his final wartime assignment, to Service Command of the Fleet Marine Force, he saw the evolution of the Marine Corps into a virtually independent branch of the U.S. armed forces. Edson, a leading Marine advocate during the postwar debate on preserving the corps, resigned rather than accept the compromises of the 1947 National Security Act determing the missions of the services. His suicide in 1955 at age 58 has obscured his distinguished career. Military freelance writer Hoffman's comprehensive biography goes far to restore Red Mike's stature in the history of the corps he loved. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The dawn-breakers: Nabi&#x301;l's narrative of the early days of the Baha&#x301;&#x2be;i&#x301; revelation</h2><p>As pictured in gently used condition.

Berry Brazelton, has developed a theory of infant self-calming, a technique in which "the baby settles herself down without assistance from anyone." Sammons offers sound advice for new parents coping with feeding and quieting an infant, encouraging them to observe and communicate with the new baby. He warns parents against overstimulation, often the result of reacting too quickly to a baby's crying, and describes the different types of crying. He stresses teaching the infant to calm itself by sucking, visual focusing, or positioning, a process that can take weeks, but will result in improved family life.

Malka Drucker lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.A delicately beautiful woman who smoked and drank "like a mariachi" and enjoyed her own sexual freedom even as she suffered the infidelities of her adored husband Diego Rivera, Kahlo painted ferociously honest visions of her private world. In this first volume of the Bantam-Barnard Biography series, Drucker graphically recounts the artist's devastating accident and tortured physical life with a fearlessness to match Kahlo's own. No apologies are made for Kahlo's many love affairs with both men and women or for her unabashed support of Communism as a means of allaying endemic poverty. Detailed analyses of Kahlo's autobiographical paintings convey the surreal morbidity of Mexican culture as well as the facts of a brief but abundantly gifted life. From the opening scenes of a young, polio-stricken Frida conjuring up an imaginary friend to the final hallucinatory image of the dead artist, we are irresistibly drawn to this woman whose life has much to teach about passion, courage and self-determination.

East of the Gabilans is a unique history of this special land. Here is the record of the Spanish and Mexican land grants, the ranchos of pre-American California, the lives of the Spanish and Mexicans, and the advent of the Americans in the 1840s and 1850s -- the Castros, the Breens, the towns of San Juan Bautista, Hollister, Gilroy, and Tres Pinos, and Henry Miller, the Cattle King.</p><p></p><h2>Dean Acheson: The Cold War Years, 1953-71</h2><p>DEAN ACHESON is best remembered as President Harry Truman's powerful secretary of state, the American father of NATO, and a major architect of U.S. foreign policy in the decade following the Second World War. But Acheson also played a major role in politics and foreign affairs after his tenure in the Truman administration, as an important Democratic Party activist and theorist during the Eisenhower presidency and as a valued adviser during the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations. This engrossing book, the first to chronicle Acheson's postsecretarial career, paints a portrait of a brilliant, irascible, and powerful man acting during a turbulent period in American history.<br>Drawing on the recently opened Acheson papers as well as on interviews with Acheson's family and with leading public figures of the era, Douglas Brinkley tells an intriguing tale that is part biography, part diplomatic history, and part politics. Brinkley considers Acheson's role in numerous NATO-related debates and task forces, the Berlin and Cuban missile crises, Vietnam War decision-making, the Cyprus dispute of 1964, the anti-de Gaulle initiative of the 1960s, and U.S.-African policy. He describes Acheson as a staunch anticommunist with a persistent Eurocentric focus, a man who was intolerant of American leaders such as George Kennan, J. William Fulbright, and Walter Lippmann for opposing his views, and who often feuded with JFK, LBJ, Robert McNamara, and Dean Rusk. Finally, angered at the activities of anti-Vietnam War liberal Democrats, Acheson found himself in 1969 serving as one of Nixon's most important unofficial foreign policy advisers. Throughout this time, Acheson stayed in the public eye, helped by the six books he wrote after he left office (including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Present at the Creation), his television appearances, lectures, testimony before Congress, and correspondence with European statesmen. Brinkley's book illuminates Acheson as elder statesman and reveals how a unique individual was able to influence policy-making and public opinion without the official trappings of office.</p><p>Considered a major architect of postwar foreign policy, Acheson (1893-1971) served as Truman's Secretary of State from 1949 to 1953. This eminently readable study, however, doesn't focus on his career in office, but rather on his last 18 years as an oft-consulted elder statesman. During this period, Brinkley shows, Acheson continued to play a prominent role in domestic politics by providing the Democratic Party with well-articulated positions for the 1956 and 1960 presidential elections, as well as in foreign affairs. Between 1960 and his death he served as head of several NATO task forces, as special envoy to France and as foreign-policy adviser to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. He also found time to write six well-received books, including Present at the Creation , which won a Pulitzer Prize. Incorporating new material in this well-rounded portrait, Brinkley conveys the broad scope of Acheson's fertile mind, his personal integrity, and his diplomatic acumen--as well as some of his unattractive characteristics, such as his egotism, arrogance, intolerance and a caustic wit that could turn vicious. Brinkley is an assistant professor of history at Hofstra in New York. Photos. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Acheson was one of those politicians who, though out of power, remained influential in the background. Brinkley (coauthor with Townsend Hoopes of Driven Patriot: The Life and Times of James Forrestal , LJ 4/1/92) provides us with a solid and eminently readable portrait of Acheson's life after his retirement as Harry Truman's secretary of state. Describing Acheson's years in the wilderness during the Eisenhower presidency, he explains how John F. Kennedy's arrival on the scene enabled Acheson to perform the role of elder statesman and presidential adviser to both Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Especially interesting is Acheson's reconciliation with Richard Nixon, a man whom Acheson had bitterly detested while serving as secretary of state. Both men, however, shared a similar realist view of foreign policy, and Nixon sought Acheson's advice on a range of issues. Brinkley's book is important for understanding not only Acheson but also the conduct of American foreign policy between 1953 and 1971. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Ed Goedeken, Purdue Univ.

At the same time, health and environmental concerns have dramatically affected how and what we eat. The result: American cooking has never been as exciting as it is today. And Joan Nathan proves it on every page of this wonderfully rewarding book.<br><br>Crisscrossing the country, she talks to organic farmers, artisanal bread bakers and cheese makers, a Hmong farmer in Minnesota, a mango grower in Florida, an entrepreneur of Indian frozen foods in New Jersey, home cooks, and new-wave chefs.<br><br>Among the many enticing dishes she discovers are a breakfast huevos rancheros casserole; starters such as Ecuadorean shrimp ceviche, Szechuan dumplings, and Malaysian swordfish satays; pea soup with kaffir leaves; gazpacho with sashimi; pasta dressed with pistachio pesto; Iraqi rice-stuffed Vidalia onions; and main courses of Ecuadorean <i>casuela</i>, chicken<i> yasa</i> from Gambia, and couscous from Timbuktu (with dates and lamb). And there are desserts for every taste. <br><br>Old American favorites are featured, too, but often Nathan discovers a cook who has a new way with a dish, such as an asparagus salad with blood orange mayonnaise, pancakes made with blue cornmeal and pine nuts, a seafood chowder that includes monkfish, and a chocolate bread pudding with dried cherries. <br><br>Because every recipe has a story behind it, <i>The New American Cooking</i> is a book that is as much fun to read as it is to cook from--a <i>must</i> for every kitchen today.</p><p>Surveying America's food scene, Joan Nathan, author of the much-praised <i>Jewish Cooking in America</i>, notes our increasing openness to exploring traditional ethnic fare as well as "new" dishes. In <i>The New American Cooking</i> she offers 280 recipes that reflect the growing influence of Asian, Indian, and Latin American cooking on our everyday tables, as well as providing formulas for the likes of Chicken with Barbecue Sauce and Jambalaya with Sausage and Shrimp--dishes to which we have returned, or never left behind. The menu-wide recipe range features such tantalizing fare as Turkish Cucumber Yogurt Soup, Tunisian Fish Couscous, and Grilled Thai Chicken with Lemongrass, and sweets including Wolfgang Puck's Kiwi Clafouti and Chocolate Bread Pudding with Dried Cherries and Brandied Cream Sauce. A chapter on vegetables and vegetarian dishes, with the likes of Ragout of Wild Mushrooms with Shallots and Thyme, and Saut�ed Baby Artichokes with Fresh Herbs, is particularly strong. Nathan likes to tell stories, and in sidebars such as "Nova Kim, the Wild Mushroom Lady of Vermont" and "Cooking Iraqi Food in Virginia," she places the dishes within their cultural context, often introducing readers to the recipe-makers themselves, all of whom she visited. Nathan also provides information on ingredients and techniques. <p> Though one might question the inclusion of very familiar formulas, like the one for chocolate chip cookies, albeit in "improved" versions, the majority of recipes will be new to most readers and all are easily accomplished. With 150 color photos, the book is a delightful addition to the Nathan canon, known for blending cultural-historical investigation with recipes of superior taste. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Joan Nathan was born in Providence, Rhode Island.

Trapped in this land in the midst of a three-way power struggle, Alice accepts an offer to stay at the Hatter&#39;s mansion. At the mansion, Alice meets the Hatter&#39;s right-hand man, Elliot March, who is likable and charming and...also sports a pair of bunny ears! And yet, Alice cannot get over the fact that Elliot is actually a Mafia hitman, willing to kill people without hesitation...In this popular Wonderland manga, the March Hare has finally arrived!!</p><p>QuinRose is a Japanese game developer that produces dating-sim games for girls, including the bestselling Alice in the Country of Hearts. Many of their other productions are also loosely based on works of fiction.When publisher Tokyopop closed its doors, there were fears that many of their series would hang in limbo. So there was much rejoicing when Yen Press rescued Alice in the Country of Hearts, the best-selling series based on a popular Japanese dating simulation game. In the game, and in the original three-volume manga, Alice Liddell is kidnapped from her garden by Peter White, a man with rabbit ears, and taken to Wonderland, where she is forced to stay and interact with (and be courted by) the local citizens. In this spin-off, the focus switches to Elliott March (the March Hare, a hitman for the Mafia) as Alice&#x2019;s love interest, offering readers a new couple to root for. Prior knowledge of the series is assumed, so some situations and jokes will be lost on new readers, but enough is explained to keep the story moving. The art is strong and easy to follow; many readers won&#x2019;t even realize the series has a new artist. An interesting spin on a classic tale.

Orin Newfield, a strenuously successful dairy farmer in the town of Farnum, Vermont, and an Ahab with a mouth like a cow shed, is driven by a rage of cosmic dimensions. Orin&#39;s fires were stoked early on when as a youngster he had inadvertently caused his father&#39;s death. (It was his flash recognition of his father&#39;s impotence and tolerance of being pushed around that caused him to give the home-barbering bib an extra sharp twist.) Now middle-aged, Orin cusses out man and God, specializes in gut insults, defeats his good and gentle wife, Alma, and on Christmas Day beats up his drunken handyman for spilled milk. Outraged, the townsfolk bring him to trial but Alma&#39;s sacrificial lying acquits him. Nevertheless Orin, scalded by the threat of weakness, fights free from dependence: &#34;&#34;I don&#39;t want to be protected. . . . I want to know what&#39;s happening to me. I want to know that I&#39;m alive.&#34;&#34; And the townsfolk huddle and come up with the instinctively right weapon--a pretense that he is dead and does not exist. Alma, strained beyond endurance, also leaves him ill the same fashion. In revenge Orin hangs himself, after coolly laying out clues pointing to a lynch murder. A high altitude performance, at the close of which the glinting windshields of New York invaders indicate an end to archetypal Yankee enclosures. The Last Puritan--with an extra Y chromosome.</p><p></p><h2>The Unburied</h2><p>In Victorian England, Dr. Courtine is invited to spend the days before Christmas with Austin, a friend from his youth, in the Cathedral Close of Thurchester. Courtine hopes to research an unsolved mystery at the cathedral library, but when Austin captivates him with the story of the town ghost -- a macabre tale of murder and deception dating back two centuries -- Courtine finds himself drawn instead into a haunting world of avarice, skullduggery, and exceptional evil. <br> Daring, unpredictable, atmospheric, <i>The Unburied</i> is a dazzling entry in the canon of classic Victorian masterpieces of suspense.</p><p>Though putatively a mystery set (mostly) in the Victorian age, Charles Palliser's <i>The Unburied</i> has more in common with Umberto Eco than Arthur Conan Doyle. Like <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, this novel is set in a scholarly community and features a lost manuscript as the McGuffin of choice. And here, too, the mystery is not really what the book is about at all. Palliser's tale centers on Edward Courtine, a Cambridge don with a bee in his bonnet about Alfred the Great. It doesn't take a great medievalist to figure out that Courtine has allowed emotion to cloud his reason concerning the Saxon monarch: his version of Alfred's life and character is so forgiving as to be downright suspicious.<p> When it is suggested that a source dear to his heart may in fact be fraudulent, he accuses his critics of cowardice. According to Courtine, those revisionist scoundrels doubt the veracity of his beloved source "because their own self-serving cynicism is reproached by the portrait of the king that Grimbald offers. You see, his account confirms how extraordinarily brave and resourceful and learned Alfred was, and what a generous and much-loved man." Now Courtine has come to the cathedral town of Thurcester because he believes Grimbald's original manuscript may be in the cathedral library--a manuscript that he hopes will validate his own version of the great king's reign.</p><p> Palliser takes his time setting up his story, seeding it with clues that more often than not lead to dead ends. We learn, for example, that Courtine was once married, that his wife ran off with another man, and that he blames his school pal Austin Fickling for the rupture in his marital bliss. Dark doings at the cathedral are also hinted at, with quite a lot of space devoted to a murder that occurred centuries earlier. Meanwhile, ecclesiastical renovations turn up some unpleasant surprises--and as yet another murder ensues, Courtine is swept up in less scholarly pursuits. As the hapless academic (a Watson without a Holmes) pursues one red herring after another, it becomes apparent that Courtine's psyche is the real mystery on hand. History, he discovers, can obscure as much as it elucidates. All these years, his obsession with an idealized past has provided an excellent refuge from the realities of his present. In the end, what he uncovers is the secret of himself--and the reader of <i>The Unburied</i> is treated to a fine ghost story, in which the ghosts are quite literally all in the mind. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><b>Charles Palliser</b> is the author of <i>The Unburied, The Quincunx,</i> and <i>Betrayals.</i> He has taught modern literature and creative writing at universities in Glasgow, London, and the United States.

But who was the real man behind the misconceptions?</p><p></p><p>In this spiritual biography, Ray Silverman explores the stories and the popular misconceptions about Johnny Appleseed as well as the truths behind the legends. As a businessman, Chapman owned nineteen nurseries and twenty other land holdings throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, brokering deals that belie the popular image of him as a wandering nomad with a tin pot on his head. But it is only once we talk about Chapman&#x2019;s spiritual convictions that we come to the core of who he was: a thoughtful and also joyful Christian who was deeply moved by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg.</p> The picture that emerges is of a lighthearted person whose convictions led him to seek harmony not only in nature but in the spiritual realms also&#x2014;and to share his bounty with as many people as he could.</p><p><p><b>Ray Silverman</b> is the author of <i>Rise Above It: Spiritual Development through the Ten Commandments</i> (co-authored with his wife, Star) and the editor of Helen Keller&#x2019;s spiritual autobiography <i>Light in My Darkness.</i> More recently, he authored the introduction for the stand-alone edition of Helen Keller&#x2019;s inspirational essay <i>How I Would Help the World.</i>&nbsp; Ray has a PhD from the University of Michigan, an MAT from Wesleyan University, and an MDiv from the Academy of the New Church Theological School. He currently serves as Associate Professor of Religion, English, and Moral Philosophy at Bryn Athyn College, and is an adjunct instructor at Urbana University, the home of the Johnny Appleseed Education Center and Museum, and the Chapman School of Leadership in Sustainability. <br><br><b>Nancy Poes</b><b></b>was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey and received a BA in history from the University of California Berkeley. She studied illustration at Georgia State University in Atlanta. Since 2006, she has lived and painted in Santa Fe after twenty years in Hawaii and extensive time in Portugal. Her work is part of many international public, corporate, and private collections.</p><p>Many of the talented researchers who have devoted substantial time and energy to uncovering the true story of Johnny Appleseed have not been students of [Emanuel] Swedenborg. Admittedly, it takes many years and thoughtful study to thoroughly understand Swedenborg&#x2019;s theology. While the basics are simple (love God, love your neighbor), the explanations are complex and vast. This is perhaps why Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803&#x2013;82) was inspired to say, &#x201c;The most remarkable step in the religious history of recent ages is that made by the genius of Swedenborg. A colossal soul, he lies vast abroad of his times, uncomprehended by them, and requires a long focal distance to be seen. . . . He is not to be measured by whole colleges of ordinary scholars."</p><p>In some cases, the inability to fully comprehend Swedenborg&#x2019;s theology has resulted in mistaken ideas about the true nature of Johnny Appleseed. Scholars have conjectured about why he never married, why he lived in the woods, why he was a vegetarian, why he wouldn&#x2019;t harm a mosquito, and why he wore a cooking pot on his head. Their conclusions are based on stories that have been handed down through the generations. For the most part, these stories are childhood impressions and dim recollections, passed down in a historical version of &#x201c;whisper down the lane.&#x201d; And many are &#x201c;tall tales&#x201d; told merely to amuse children, but later retold as fact.</p><p>To reason about Johnny in this way is to draw conclusions based on his outward appearance and not on his essence. It would be like judging a book by its cover, an apple by its peel, or a person by a story about them. In this book, we will go beyond the outward appearance and take a new look at Johnny Appleseed. We will examine the peel (what people saw), enjoy the fruit (what he did), and discover the core of Johnny Appleseed (who he really was).</p></p><h2>How Indians Used Desert Plants</h2><p>The deserts of the Southwest contain a multitude of plant species that have sustained human life for thousands of years. Plants provided most of the food resources as well as the raw materials for medicines, tools, shelter, and even ceremonial objects. Indeed, the knowledge held by Indians regarding their botanical environment was, by necessity, vast. Native Americans were not simply gatherers of fruits, seeds, and other resources provided by wild plants. Every cultural group used various techniques to store and preserve food plants, often for periods lasting several months or even longer. Some tribes also practiced various forms of agriculture- from simple scattering of seeds at sites of likely germination to intensive irrigation and modification of desert landscapes. Many groups were known to carefully select seeds from the best stock to improve yield, taste and nutrition of future crops. All this was going on long before Europeans arrived in America. One of the often overlooked aspects of the harvesting of food resources in hunting and gathering societies is the contribution of women. For decades academic and popular literature portrayed men as important, if not the primary suppliers of food for the family and village. Yet numerous recent studies have shown that in hunting and gathering economies women provide the bulk of the food resources through the collecting of leaves, roots, fruits and seeds...often more than ninety percent of all the food consumed! There is every reason to believe this was the case with most Indian groups living in the Southwest deserts. Today, commercial agricultural products have replaced native plants in Indian diets. Valuable information regarding desert plants, that passed from one generation to the next, is no longer necessary to sustain life and is therefore in danger of being lost. As society moves onward, it risks leaving behind the often untold knowledge of the desert&#39;s first people.</p><p></p><h2>The Life and Death of the SLA (Symbionese Liberation Army) : A True Story of Revolutionary Terror</h2><p>Vivid!

Boxer Santaros awakens deep in the Nevada desert... alone, stricken with amnesia. He is rescued by a drifter named Fortunio Balducci, only to discover that the world around him has suddenly changed. America now stands on the brink of social, economic and environmental disaster... approaching the three-year anniversary of dual nuclear attacks on Texas soil. As Boxer struggles to regain his memory, his paths cross with a mysterious adult film star named Krysta now at the Nevada/California state line. Krysta reveals her psychic abilities to Boxer in the form of a prophetic screenplay that foreshadows the apocalypse...</p><p>Kelly's film <i>Donnie Darko </i>was full of mysterious happenings that tied into the emotional tale of an oddball high school boy. This graphic novel, the first of three that lead up to the upcoming film of the same name, continues Kelly's tradition of intriguing concepts but on a much grander scale. This volume alone introduces a Guns 'n' Roses-like singing porn star, a roller coaster that can travel through time, an amnesiac movie star and what must be one of the stupidest screenplays ever written. Through strong character work and swift storytelling, this book channels a certain modern zeitgeist of terrorism fears, the loss of privacy and the cutthroat world of celebrity. The book takes place in 2008, following twin atomic attacks on Texas that have made the United States a version of Orwell's envisioned future, although Orwell didn't think to include online gambling and strip clubs into his story of fascism. Weldele's art is loose and sketchy, but also expressive when dealing with these wildly different characters. His coloring creates a great sense of atmosphere that is lonely and oppressive, perfect for the story's subject matter, which is basically an intriguing setup for what will hopefully pay off in the film. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Television brought not only situation comedies but controversial congressional hearings into millions of living rooms. While Alfred Kinsey was studying people&#39;s sex lives, Gregory Pincus and other researchers began work on a pill that would forever alter the course of American reproductive practices.

Born in Afghanistan&#x2019;s remote Farah Province, she grew up in refugee camps in Iran and Pakistan before returning to Afghanistan as a social activist and a teacher at underground girls&#x2019; schools during the Taliban&#x2019;s reign. In 2003 she was elected to Afghanistan&#x2019;s constitutional assembly and, two years later, was the youngest person elected to Afghanistan&#x2019;s new Parliament, a post from which she was suspended in 2007 for her regular denunciation of the country&#x2019;s warlords and their cronies in government.<i><b>Introduction</b></i><br><b>Dust in the Eyes of the World</b><br><br><p>I come from a land of tragedy called Afghanistan.</p><p>My life has taken some unusual turns, but in many ways my story is the story of a generation. For the thirty years I have been alive, my country has suffered from the constant scourge of war. Most Afghans my age and younger have only known bloodshed, displacement, and occupation. When I was a baby in my mother's arms, the Soviet Union invaded my country. When I was four years old, my family and I were forced to live as refugees in Iran and then Pakistan. Millions of Afghans were killed or exiled, like my family, during the battle-torn 1980s. When the Russians finally left and their puppet regime was overthrown, we faced a vicious civil war between fundamentalist warlords, followed by the rule of the depraved and medieval Taliban.</p><p>After the tragic day of September 11, 2001, many in Afghanistan thought that, with the ensuing overthrow of the Taliban, they might finally see some light, some justice and progress. But it was not to be. The Afghan people have been betrayed once again by those who are claiming to help them. More than seven years after the U.S. invasion, we are still faced with foreign occupation and a U.S.-backed government filled with warlords who are just like the Taliban. Instead of putting these ruthless murderers on trial for war crimes, the United States and its allies placed them in positions of power, where they continue to terrorize ordinary Afghans.</p><p>You may be shocked to hear this, because the truth about Afghanistan has been hidden behind a smoke screen of words and images carefully crafted by the United States and its NATO allies and repeated without question by the Western media.</p><p>You may have been led to believe that once the Taliban was driven from power, justice returned to my country. Afghan women like me, voting and running for office, have been held up as proof that the U.S. military has brought democracy and women's rights to Afghanistan.</p><p>But it is all a lie, dust in the eyes of the world.</p><p>I am the youngest member of the Afghan Parliament, but I have been banished from my seat and threatened with death because I speak the truth about the warlords and criminals in the puppet government of Hamid Karzai. I have already survived at least five assassination attempts and uncounted plots against me. Because of this, I am forced to live like a fugitive within my own country. A trusted uncle heads my detail of bodyguards, and we move to different houses almost every night to stay a step ahead of my enemies.</p><p>To hide my identity, I must travel under the cover of the heavy cloth burqa, which to me is a symbol of women's oppression, like a shroud for the living. Even during the dark days of the Taliban I could at least go outside under the burqa to teach girls in secret classes. But today I don't feel safe under my burqa, even with armed guards to escort me. My visitors are searched for weapons, and even the flowers at my wedding had to be checked for bombs. I cannot tell you my family's name, or the name of my husband, because it would place them in terrible danger. And for this reason, I have changed several other names in this book.</p><p>I call myself Joya -- an alias I adopted during the time of the Taliban when I worked as an underground activist. The name Joya has great significance in my country. Sarwar Joya was an Afghan writer, poet, and constitutionalist who struggled against injustice during the early twentieth century. He spent nearly twenty-four years of his life in jails and was finally killed because he would not compromise his democratic principles.</p><p>I know that because I refuse to compromise my opposition to the warlords and fundamentalists or soften my speeches denouncing them, I, too, may join Joya on the long list Afghans who have died for freedom. But you cannot compromise the truth. And I am not afraid of an early death if it would advance the cause of justice. Even the grave cannot silence my voice, because there are others who would carry on after me.</p><p>The sad fact is that in Afghanistan, killing a woman is like killing a bird. The United States has tried to justify its occupation with rhetoric about "liberating" Afghan women, but we remain caged in our country, without access to justice and still ruled by women-hating criminals. Fundamentalists still preach that "a woman should be in her house or in the grave." In most places it is still not safe for a woman to appear in public uncovered, or to walk on the street without a male relative. Girls are still sold into marriage. Rape goes unpunished every day.</p><p>For both men and women in Afghanistan, our lives are short and often wracked by violence, loss, and anguish. The life expectancy here is less than forty-five years -- an age that in the West is called "middle age." We live in desperate poverty. A staggering 70 percent of Afghans survive on less than two dollars per day. And it is estimated that more than half of Afghan men and 80 percent of women are illiterate. In the past few years, hundreds of women have committed self-immolation -- literally burned themselves to death -- to escape their miseries.</p><p>This is the history I have lived through, and this is the tragic situation today that I am working with many others to change. I am no better than any of my suffering people. Fate and history have made me in some ways a "voice of the voiceless," the many thousands and millions of Afghans who have endured decades of war and injustice.</p><p>For years, my supporters have urged me to write a book about my life. I have always resisted because I do not feel comfortable writing about myself. I feel that my story, on its own, is not important. But finally my friends persuaded me to go ahead with this book as a way to talk about the plight of the Afghan people from the perspective of a member of my country's war generation. I agreed to use my personal experiences as a way to tell the political history of Afghanistan, focusing on the past three decades of oppressive misrule. The story of the dangerous campaign I ran to represent the poor people of my province, the physical and verbal attacks I endured as a member of Parliament, and the devious, illegal plot to banish me from my elected post -- all of it illuminates the corruption and injustice that prevents Afghanistan from becoming a true democracy. In this way it is not just my story, but the story of my struggling people.</p><p>Many books were written about Afghanistan after the 9/11 tragedy, but only a few of them offer a complete and realistic picture of the country's past. Most of them describe in depth the cruelties and injustices of the Taliban regime but usually ignore or try to hide one of the darkest periods of our history: the rule of the fundamentalist mujahideen between 1992 and 1996. I hope this book will draw attention to the atrocities committed by these warlords who now dominate the Karzai regime.</p><p>I also hope this book will correct the tremendous amount of misinformation being spread about Afghanistan. Afghans are sometimes represented in the media as a backward people, nothing more than terrorists, criminals, and henchmen. This false image is extremely dangerous for the future of both my country and the West. The truth is that Afghans are brave and freedom-loving people with a rich culture and a proud history. We are capable of defending our independence, governing ourselves, and determining our own future.</p><p>But Afghanistan has long been used as a deadly playground in the "Great Game" between superpowers, from the British Empire to the Soviet empire, and now the Americans and their allies. They have tried to rule Afghanistan by dividing it. They have given money and power to thugs and fundamentalists and warlords who have driven our people into terrible misery. We do not want to be misused and misrepresented to the world. We need security and a helping hand from friends around the world, but not this endless U.S.-led "war on terror," which is in fact a war against the Afghan people. The Afghan people are not terrorists; we are the victims of terrorism. Today the soil of Afghanistan is full of land mines, bullets, and bombs -- when what we really need is an invasion of hospitals, clinics, and schools for boys and girls.</p><p>I was also reluctant to write this memoir because I'd always thought that books should first be written about the many democratic activists who have been martyred, the secret heroes and heroines of Afghanistan's history. I feel the same way about some of the awards that I have received from international human rights groups in recent years. The ones who came before me are more deserving. It is an honor to be recognized, but I only wish that all the love and support I have been shown could be given to the orphans and widows of Afghanistan. For me, the awards and honors belong to all my people, and each distinction I receive only adds to my sense of responsibility to our common struggle. For this reason, all of my earnings from this book will go toward supporting urgently needed humanitarian projects in Afghanistan aimed at changing lives for the better.</p><p>As I write these words, the situation in Afghanistan is getting progressively worse. And not just for women, but for all Afghans. We are caught between two enemies -- the Taliban on one side and the U.S./ NATO forces and their warlord friends on the other. And the dark-minded forces in our country are gaining power with every allied air strike that kills civilians, with every corrupt government official who grows fat on bribes and thievery, and with every criminal who escapes justice.</p><p>During his election campaign, the new president of the United States, Barack Obama, spoke of sending tens of thousands more foreign troops to Afghanistan, but he did not speak out against the twin plagues of corruption and warlordism that are destroying my country. I know that Obama's election has brought great hopes to peace-loving people in the United States. But for Afghans, Obama's military buildup will only bring more suffering and death to innocent c...</p></p><h2>Horrible Histories Cut Throat Celts</h2><p>Readers can discover all the foul facts about the Cut-throat Celts, including why weird Celt warriors fought with no clothes on, how to preserve your enemy&#39;s brain and why the Celts laughed at funerals.

Long lines of miserable refugees were plodding away from the city, automobiles, trucks, buses inching along, bumper to bumper, piled high with mattresses, bicycles, clothes washers, sticks of furniture; others were on foot, sloshing stolidly through the rain, the water knee-deep in some places, carrying babies and bundles of whatever they could salvage from their ruined homes. <br>&#x201c;Kill the display,&#x201d; Chiang commanded. <br>The virtual reality simulation disappeared. Chiang was sitting in his powerchair in the middle of the VR chamber, a wizened, bald, crippled old man connected to the blinking, softly beeping heart pump and artificial lungs and other machinery that kept his emaciated body alive. <br>Felicia Ionescu was a tall, imposing figure, generously proportioned as an old-time opera diva, and just as imperious. At this moment, though, she did not look haughty or domineering.

And now this.&#x201d; <br>He pointed a wavering clawlike finger at the satellite map of the world that covered one wall of the VR chamber. China&#x2019;s long rivers were now broad arms of the sea reaching a thousand kilometers inland, drowning villages and whole cities, killing hundreds of thousands, wiping out millions upon millions of hectares of productive farmlands. <br>Where once the Mississippi River had wound its peaceful way from the northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, a great inland sea was spreading, flooding Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, reaching up into Missouri and still growing. <br>The Nile was inundating Egypt and the Sudan, drowning the Sphinx and lapping against the great pyramids. The swollen Orinoco River and mighty Amazon had virtually split South America into two separate subcontinents. Coastlines around the world were no longer recognizable: the sea was inexorably conquering the land. <br>&#x201c;This wasn&#x2019;t supposed to happen,&#x201d; Chiang insisted, his voice a painful rasp. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve stopped burning fossil fuels. We&#x2019;ve removed gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not enough,&#x201d; said Ionescu, mournfully. Like Chiang, she spoke Mandarin, but with a Romanian accent that was painful to the old man&#x2019;s ears. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing everything we can,&#x201d; he insisted. <br>&#x201c;We started too late. Despite all our efforts, the global climate has tipped into a warm cycle. The Greenland ice cap is melting. So is Antarctica. And there&#x2019;s nothing we can do to stop it.&#x201d; She took a breath, then added, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re paying for starting too late. We did nothing for more than a century, and now it&#x2019;s too late to prevent the floods.&#x201d; <br>Chiang craned his wattled neck to glare up at her. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re back again to wheedle me into approving a backup mission to Sirius? How many times do I have to tell you it&#x2019;s impossible?&#x201d; <br>Ionescu closed her eyes, then said, as if reciting from rote, &#x201c;As director of the International Astronautical Authority, it is my duty to remind you once again that the exploration program calls for several backup missions.&#x201d; <br>Waving his withered arm toward the satellite imagery again, Chiang demanded, &#x201c;And what do I tell the people of Chongqing? And St. Louis? And Cairo and S�o Paulo and all the other cities that have been flooded? How do we feed the refugees? Where do we house them?&#x201d; <br>Ionescu said, &#x201c;We should have launched the first backup mission seventy-five years ago, long before either you or I came into power.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do you know what the Council would do if I recommended we send a backup mission to Sirius?&#x201d; Chiang screeched. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d flay me alive and nail me to the gate of the Forbidden City!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You exaggerate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked all my life to save our world from disaster. I&#x2019;ve fought my way to chairmanship of the World Council. I&#x2019;m not going to allow the IAA or any force on Earth to distract me from my purpose.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s less than two and a half billion kiloyuan for the first backup mission,&#x201d; Ionescu replied, her voice rising slightly. &#x201c;We have all the basic facilities in place. We have the organizational infrastructure.&#x201d; <br>Chiang took a deep breath, while the life-support equipment on the back of his chair chattered angrily. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the <i>amount</i> of money, woman, it&#x2019;s the symbolism. Here we&#x2019;re struck with the worst disaster since the original greenhouse floods five generations ago, and you want to spend badly needed funds on sending another team of pampered scientists to Sirius! It&#x2019;s impossible!&#x201d; <br>Working hard to control her own volatile temper, Ionescu said, &#x201c;The first team should have reached Sirius by now. They&#x2019;re only twelve people&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If they need help let them ask for it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Their messages take more than eight years to get here. They&#x2019;re effectively alone, isolated.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your predecessors knew that when they sent them, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course, but our original program plan called for a backup mission. Several of them, in fact.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Those plans are canceled,&#x201d; Chiang snapped. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re underwater. Drowned. Just like the village of my birth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be this way,&#x201d; Ionescu said, almost pleading. &#x201c;Twelve people, alone out there&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to have to make the best of it,&#x201d; Chiang said. &#x201c;Just as we are.&#x201d; <br>Ionescu turned from Chiang&#x2019;s age-ravaged, angry face and stared at the wall-sized satellite display. But in her mind&#x2019;s eye she saw the starship taking up its preplanned orbit around the planet Sirius C.

For the Greeks, <i>Gaia </i>or <i>Ge </i>(from which our word &#x201c;geometry&#x201d; derives) was a universe rather than a planet. Man was the measure of the cosmos and geometry was the expression of this faculty, the discipline through which one studied the unity of cosmic necessity and human thought. For this reason tradition has it that Plato inscribed on the gates of his Academy: &#x201c;Only geometers enter here.&#x201d; <br> <br> This aspect of the discipline was lost in modern times until studies such as those of Matila Ghyka rekindled an interest that culminated in R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz&#x2019;s Pythagorean synthesis. Since it was essentially a rediscovery of unselfconscious modes of thinking, this synthesis did not pose the problem of <i>foundations</i>. <i>Philosophical Geometry</i> originated in the author&#x2019;s perception of this problem while working with de Lubicz in Grasse, France, in 1960-61. <br> <br> Written in 1972, <i>Philosophical Geometry</i> was conceived as a textbook and took shape in a teaching situation, individual elaboration of theory being the declared aim. Defined as &#x201c;the activity of establishing a necessary conduct for mind through a set of signs denoting a necessary conduct of facts,&#x201d; <i>Philosophical Geometry</i> approaches a universal theme to which the existence of every human being contributes a chapter. <i>Philosophical Geometry</i> is, and has been, an avenue toward inscription of such fundamental experience.</p><p>Andr� Vandenbroeck has translated several works of Schwaller de Lubicz, and is the author of a memoir titled <i>Al-Kemi: Hermetic, Occult, Political, and Private Aspects of R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz. </i></p><h2>Dangers Men Face: Overcoming the Five Greatest Threats to Living Life Well</h2><p>Stress, work, identity, anger, sexuality.

This advanced guide to handicapping is liberally spiced with the wit and wisdom that have made Beyer a legend in the sport.</p><p>ANDREW BEYER thoroughly revolutionized handicapping when he created<br>his "Beyer Speed Figures," a measure of how fast a horse has run in a given<br>race, and an indispensable tool for horseplayers. Making the necessary<br>calculations to develop a set of figures for each horse in each race was too<br>time-consuming for most horseplayers, so in 1992 the Daily Racing Form<br>commissioned Beyer and his associates to provide his speed figures for<br>every horse competing in North America. Beyer has been a columnist for the Washington Post since 1978, and contributes regularly to the Daily Racing Form. He is considered one of the leading experts on horse racing."This exuberant memoir will delight the hearts, improve the minds, and fatten the bankrolls of horseplayers everywhere." &#x2013;Tom Ainslie<p></p> <p></p> "Andy Beyer goes to the races for all of us. Reading his book is like winning the exacta." -Jim Murray, Los Angeles Times<p></p> <p></p> "My $50000 Year at the races is an entertaining odyssey through the land of the handicapper. Andrew Beyer&#x2019;s approach to the arcane art of selecting winners makes for fascinating reading. His expertise is obvious, even to the layman, but he does not conceal the central thrust of the book- how to pick a winner- behind a fa�ade of technical verbiage, This is good reading, start to finish." &#x2013;Joe Hirsch<p></p> <p></p> "Horseplayers should forget today&#x2019;s daily double, exacta, and triple- and put their money on this sure winner." &#x2013;Bill Surface, author of <i>The Track</i></p><h2>Summer Tree (Fionavar Tapestry Book 1)</h2><p>Five university students--Kimberly, Dave, Jennifer, Kevin, and Paul--meet a wizard who takes them to the heart of all worlds, Fionavar, where they discover who they were truly meant to be.</p><p>It all began with a lecture that introduced five university students to a man who would change their lives, a wizard who could take them from Earth to the heart of the first of all worlds--Fionavar.

Their found and recycled materials are reincarnated to create clothing, jewelry, toys, artworks, and useful household objects, such as a measuring scale made of two sardine cans. Focusing on the folk art practices of several cultures, this book is a celebration of the transformative genius of these artists, as well as an exploration of the diverse environments--from Ecuador and Mexico to Senegal and the U.S.--in which they live and work.The saying "One person's trash is another person's treasure" is given new meaning in this lively survey of folk art made from all kinds of discarded industrial objects such as bottle caps, cans, machine parts, license plates, rubber sandals, and newspapers. Curator Cerny and folklorist Seriff examine this phenomenon on many levels, beginning close to home with an analysis of American concepts of thrift and wastefulness, our pride in ingenuity, and the gleeful rejection of the "fine" art world by "outsider" artists. As Cerny, Seriff, and their contributors broaden their scope and discuss examples of "recycled" art from around the world, they continue to analyze the "thingness" of Western society and the hubris of "planned obsolescence" and extravagant packaging. As we admire the ingenious creations documented here, which run the gamut from immense outdoor structures to jewelry, we salute the resourcefulness of individuals but hope for corporate, more ambitious forms of recycling in the near future. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Secret Pleasure (Bound Hearts)</h2><p><p><b><i>The secret is out: #1 bestselling author Lora Leigh&#x2019;s Bound Hearts series is so hot, it should come with a warning...</i></b></p><p> Sebastian and Shane De Loren were born to love Alyssa Hampstead.

Every culture in the world creates hauntings for itself, things that lurk in the shadows and wait for the unwary. Yet, at the same time, there are certain ghost stories and certain forms of haunting that seem to be quintessentially American. This leads us to the story of the Phantom Prom Date. Her story is considered an example of the Hitchhiking Ghost sub-type (see Appendix A for further details on the base legend), but has been expanded into a cautionary tale for teenagers about the dangers of driving recklessly. It is perhaps no coincidence that the Phantom Prom Date first began to walk the roads of America in the early 1950s, when concern for teen driving was at a national high.<br> &nbsp;<br> The most interesting thing about this legend is that it presents a hitchhiking ghost with no specific geographical ties. Unlike Chicago&#x2019;s White Mary or New Hampshire&#x2019;s Lonely John, the Phantom Prom Date can be seen anywhere in North America, and has made appearances in locations as diverse as Florida, Ontario, and the Pacific Northwest. The only American state with no recorded sightings is Hawaii, which fits with the legend&#x2014; how would a ghost whose only means of travel is the highway reach a state surrounded entirely by water?<br> &nbsp;<br> The physical appearance of the Phantom Prom Date may also be relevant. One would expect a legend this far-ranging to present with a dozen different descriptions, but all recorded sightings have included the same details. She is in her mid-teens, with shoulder-length, light brown or dark blonde hair, Caucasian, attractive enough to be noticed without being strikingly beautiful, and wearing a green silk prom dress with matching dress flats. Neither the style of her hair nor the style of her dress changes from report to report; she seems to be caught in the era where she died, forever roaming the highways of America, forever looking for someone who can help her find the way home . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014; <i>On the Trail of the Phantom Prom Date</i>, Professor Laura<br> Moorhead, University of Colorado.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>1973</b><br> <b>The Dead Girl in the Diner</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> THERE&#x2019;S THIS VOCABULARY WORD&#x2014; &#x201c;linear.&#x201d; It means things that happen in a straight line, like highways and essays about what you did on your summer vacation. It means A comes before B, and B comes before C, all the way to the end of the alphabet, end of the road . . . end of the line. That&#x2019;s linear.<br> &nbsp;<br> The living are real fond of linear. The dead . . . not so much. It&#x2019;s harder to make everything fall into a straight line when nothing begins until you die. The dead begin our &#x201c;lives&#x201d; as newborns with heads full of memories, and it can make even the most straightforward story a little difficult to follow. I&#x2019;ll do my best.<br> &nbsp;<br> My name is Rose Marshall. This is not a story about my life, although my life will occasionally intrude on the proceedings. It&#x2019;s messy and unfortunate. It&#x2019;s also unavoidable. Sorry about that. Only not really, because like I said, the dead aren&#x2019;t all that invested in &#x201c;linear,&#x201d; and I&#x2019;ve been dead for a long damn time.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was born in 1936. The country was just starting to come out of the Great Depression. Skirts were tight, movies were big business, and everyone was trying to put their best foot forward. Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t sunshine and roses for everybody. My parents were still tightening their belts and pulling up their bootlaces when little Rosie Marshall made the scene, just one more mouth to feed and one more untried heart to break. They wouldn&#x2019;t be feeding me for long. Daddy split when I was eight years old. Me, I made it all the way to 1952, sixteen short years of chances and choices and opportunities. And then it was over.<br> &nbsp;<br> I died on a hot summer night in my junior year of high school, driven off the road by a man who should never have been there. My body was battered almost past recognition by the accident. My spirit fared a little better, sweet sixteen for the rest of time, missing the warm coat of life&#x2019;s embrace.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was alive, and then I wasn&#x2019;t. Someday, they&#x2019;ll say the same thing about everyone. Someday, they&#x2019;ll say the same thing about you.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are a lot of names for people like me, the ones who can&#x2019;t let go, even when the movie&#x2019;s over and the credits finish rolling. Specter, haunt, phantom . . . and my personal favorite, the sweet and simple &#x201c;ghost.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ghost&#x201d; is a lot like &#x201c;linear&#x201d;: it&#x2019;s a word that doesn&#x2019;t fuck around pretending to be something it&#x2019;s not. There are even a lot of names for me in specific, names that try to dance around the word &#x201c;Rose.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m the phantom prom date, the woman at the diner, the girl in the green silk gown, and the walking girl of Route 42. But most of all, I&#x2019;m the ghost of Sparrow Hill Road. Rosie Marshall. Just one more girl who raced and lost in the hand of the forest, the shade of the hill, on the hairpin curves of that damned deadly hill.<br> &nbsp;<br> People call me a lot of things these days. You can call me Rose.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now come with me.<br> &nbsp;<br> ~<br> &nbsp;<br> The truck stop air has that magical twang that you only ever find in roadside dives that have had time to fully merge with their environment. It&#x2019;s a mixture of baked asphalt, diesel fumes, hot exhaust, and hotter exhaustion. The smell of grease and lard- based piecrusts join the symphony as I get closer to the obligatory diner, the charmingly named FORK YOU GRILL. The smell of ashes and lilies runs under it all, cold and enticing as the grave, and I know that I am where I am supposed to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> My fingers are cold. My fingers are always cold, and the coat I&#x2019;m wearing is too thin to really warm them up. I got it from a twenty-something on his way to California to be a rock musician. He said it belonged to his little sister. From the smell of the perfume permanently bonded to the denim, she was only his little sister if his little sister was moonlighting as a prostitute. But who am I to judge? I traded the coat for a backseat quickie, and now my hands are cold no matter how far I shove them into my hooker&#x2019;s-coat pockets, and I can taste the truck stop air. Being dead is one of those things that really teaches you how to be glad to be alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> The distant drone of cars on the highway accompanies me across the parking lot, my shoes crunching on the glass and gravel. The sound of the jukebox slithers out to meet me as I open the diner door, Top 40 country hits with all the passion of a dead dog on the side of the highway. I keep on going. I&#x2019;m not here for the music.<br> &nbsp;<br> The air inside the diner is hot and dry and sweet with coffee and apple pie and the distant ghosts of greasy breakfasts past. Half a dozen truckers sit belly- up to the counter on stools twice the size of standard; this is a place that stays alive on the trucker trade, and isn&#x2019;t ashamed of that reality. Another half- dozen patrons are sprinkled around the place, seated haphazardly at booths and tables. That tells me what the deal is even before I see the hand- written sign inviting me to &#x201c;PLZ SEAT YOURSELF, B RIGHT WITH U.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> From the expressions of the folks who aren&#x2019;t too tired to enjoy their food, the staff here cooks better than they spell. That&#x2019;s for the best. Killing your customers with food poisoning isn&#x2019;t a good way to stay in business.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s something not-quite-right about one of the truckers, a barrel-chested man with a neat little goatee and the hands of an artist. He has those artist&#x2019;s hands wrapped tight around a coffee mug, stealing heat through the porcelain like a small child stealing cookies from the cookie jar. Most of the eyes in the diner skitter right off me, frightened mice catching the scent of a cat, but not him. He doesn&#x2019;t look at me for long, but when he does, he <i>sees </i>me.<br> &nbsp;<br> That, even more than the scent of ash and lilies lingering in the air around him, tells me he&#x2019;s the one I&#x2019;ve come here for; he&#x2019;s the one that called me, made me give up a perfectly good westward ride to come to this middle-of-nowhere dive with nothing but the coat on my back and the frostbite on my fingers. I can&#x2019;t save him, but I know him.<br> &nbsp;<br> At least, I know his kind. He&#x2019;s in the process of sliding into the space between two Americas. This one, where the air tastes like apple pie and the jukebox plays the Top 40, and a quieter, colder America, one where the kisses pretty girls sometimes give never taste of anything but empty rooms and broken promises. He&#x2019;s falling into my America, and there&#x2019;s not a damn thing to be done about it. It&#x2019;s not the sort of trip that you recover from. If the scent around him were rosemary and sugary perfume, maybe, but ashes and lilies . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s nothing to be done. The record on the jukebox changes as I walk toward the counter. The Country Gentlemen, &#x201c;Bringing Mary Home.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I hate it when the inanimate pretends to have a sense of humor.<br> &nbsp;<br> ~<br> &nbsp;<br> He looks up when I sit down, a flicker of interest showing in his eyes. They&#x2019;re the color of sun- faded denim, all their darkness bleached out by the road. The blue-eyed boys have always been my weakness. I meet that brief look with a smile that&#x2019;s more sincere than I intended, flashing white teeth between candy-apple-red lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s hard to dress for the truck stop circuit. Can&#x2019;t be too wholesome or they&#x2019;re afraid to even talk to you; there&#x2019;s too much of a chance that you&#x2019;re some sort of lure set out by the local cops. Sandra Dee doesn&#x2019;t play with the long-haul boys. Neither does her evil twin: going too far the other way makes you look like you&#x2019;re just another lot lizard, worth the price of a blow job, but not worth the cost of conversation. So here I am in flannel shirt under denim jacket over too-tight wife-beater tank top, faded jeans worn as thin as paper, hiking boots, and makeup that would verge on slutty if it wasn&#x2019;t so inexpertly applied.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know my audience. I&#x2019;ve had a lot of time to study it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I say, with a questioning lilt that blurs the remnants of my accent, blotting out the route signs that might lead back to my origins. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Rose. Do you, um, come here often?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looks my way again. His eyes are kind. That makes it a little easier. We&#x2019;re about to get to know each other real well, and it&#x2019;s better when their eyes are kind. &#x201c;Let me stop you right there, honey. You&#x2019;re way too young for me. Hell, you&#x2019;re way too young to be out here at all. Don&#x2019;t you have a home to go to?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not for a long time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Disapproval overtakes the kindness like the sun going down&#x2014; but the disapproval isn&#x2019;t directed at me, and that makes what has to happen next easier still. &#x201c;When&#x2019;s the last time you ate?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This time I don&#x2019;t have to force myself to smile. &#x201c;Too long ago.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the truth. I&#x2019;m always hungry&#x2014; one more consequence of being what I am&#x2014; and I have to follow certain rules. If the living choose to feed me while I&#x2019;m material, the food has flavor and substance. If I try to feed myself, it&#x2019;s only air and ashes, like chewing on nothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would you mind if I bought you a burger?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; I slide over a little on my stool, trying to make myself comfortable. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to buy me a burger, can you tell me your name, maybe? I like to know who I&#x2019;m thanking.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Larry. Larry Vibber.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pleased to meet you, Larry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pleased to meet you, too, Rose,&#x201d; he says, and laughs as he waves for the waitress to come over to our little stretch of counter. I&#x2019;d feel guilty, if I had anything to feel guilty about. There are worse ways to spend your last night on Earth than buying dinner for a stranger in a diner, and if I wasn&#x2019;t here, he&#x2019;d be spending this time alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> ~<br> &nbsp;<br> The burger tastes like Heaven on a sesame seed bun, assuming that Heaven comes with ketchup and raw onions. If Larry wonders why I ask him to pass me the condiments before I dump them on, he doesn&#x2019;t say anything about it. The coffee is even better than the burger, and the apple pie is so damn good I could cry. The living don&#x2019;t know how lucky they are.<br> &nbsp;<br> Larry finishes his food well before I do. After that, he just watches me demolishing my meal, until I&#x2019;m chasing crumbs with the tip of my index finger and wishing I&#x2019;d thought to chew a little slower. I wish that every time. I never do it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then Larry clears his throat, and I turn to look at him again. He smiles, weakly. &#x201c;I was thinking, Rose . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A girl your age shouldn&#x2019;t be alone in a place like this. Now, I know you don&#x2019;t have much reason to trust me, and I&#x2019;ll understand if you don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a good idea, but I&#x2019;m rolling for Detroit tonight. I&#x2019;d be happy to take you along, get you to a place where maybe . . . you could find somewhere to stay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh, Larry. He won&#x2019;t be getting anywhere near Detroit tonight. I know that, I&#x2019;ve known it since I saw him across the diner, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter, because this is what happens; this is what I came here for. I push my plate away, and if he sees that my smile is painted on over sorrow, he&#x2019;s polite enough not to say anything. He&#x2019;s trying to help. Most truckers are essentially good people, living one of the few vagabond lifestyles that&#x2019;s survived into this changing world, where it gets harder every year to keep from putting down roots. They help each other when they can, and they like to be seen as shining knights riding dragons instead of snow- white chargers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; I tug my borrowed coat tighter, smelling old perfume, old sex, old lies. My lies are some of the oldest of them all, but I tell them for the very best of reasons. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d really appreciate a ride.&#x201d; Rides are what I don&#x2019;t live for, after all.<br> &nbsp;<br> The waitress who takes Larry&#x2019;s money looks at me a little too hard, a little too intently. She knows me. She&#x2019;s deep enough into the twilight Americas to know me, but she&#x2019;s still in the shallows. She&#x2019;s still too close to the daylight layers to understand <i>why </i>she knows, or what, exactly, it is that she&#x2019;s seeing. I flash her a smile. She steps backward, counts Larry&#x2019;s change wrong twice, and finally&#x2014; once she has the register closed again&#x2014; flees into the back.<br> &nbsp;<br> She won&#x2019;t be here much longer. She&#x2019;ll go back to the daylight, leave this blacktop twilight to the people who can breathe its air and not worry about suffocating. That&#x2019;s good. People like her should get out while they still can, to make up for all the people who never get the chance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then Larry leads me out of the diner, out into the night, and the waitress doesn&#x2019;t matter anymore. We&#x2019;re on the road again, and there&#x2019;s nothing that can save us now.</p><h2>Icon as Communion: The Ideals and Compositional Principles of Icon Painting</h2><p>Notes and observations on the drawing stage in icon painting.

But Winogrand was also an avid traveler and roamed extensively around the United States, bringing exquisite work out of nearly every region of the country. This landmark retrospective catalogue looks at the full sweep of Winogrand&#39;s exceptional career. Drawing from his enormous output, which at the time of his death included thousands of rolls of undeveloped film and unpublished contact sheets, the book will serve as the most substantial compendium of Winogrand&#39;s work to date. Lavishly illustrated with both iconic images and photographs that have never been seen before now, and featuring essays by leading scholars of American photography, Garry Winogrand presents a vivid portrait of an artist who unflinchingly captured America&#39;s swings between optimism and upheaval in the postwar era.</p><p></p><h2>A Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith</h2><p>Modern Christianity is awash in a flood of doctrinal relativity. Satan and his forces love the imprecision and ambiguity which are rampant in our day. As C.H. Spurgeon observed, &#39;The arch-enemy of truth has invited us to level our walls and take away our fenced cities&#39;. This exposition was originally published in 1989 to mark the 300th anniversary of the publication of the Second London Confession, which also became known as the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith. Today, reformed Baptists world-wide hold this Confession in high esteem and many churches continue to regard it as their official statement of faith. In this extensive exposition, the author Sam Waldron shows that the 1689 Confession is a masterly statement of the historic Christian faith. He writes in a direct and lucid style that will help ministers, students and laymen alike to a clear understanding of this Confession and to its relevance and application to our modern age. Included in this publication is a helpful introduction on the legitimacy and use of confessions by Dr R. P. Martin, currently Pastor of Emmanuel Reformed Baptist Church in Seattle, Washington.</p><p></p><h2>Life-Size Aquarium: Dolphin, Orca, Clownfish, Sea Otter, and More-an All-new Actual-size Animal Encyclopedia</h2><p>Not content to stay on dry land, the <i>Life-Size</i> phenomenon leaves the zoo for a visit to the aquarium.

Based on a new Code of Conduct that anyone can relate to, it is full of real life stories uniquely designed first, to help readers become self-empowered and more proficient at manifesting so that they are no longer at the mercy of people and forces outside themselves, and second, to provide a simple tried-and-true format for coming together in community to create peace, freedom, and the high quality living environment that everyone longs for and deserves. Tony Burroughs was living and farming in Hawaii when a mentor came to him and, over the course of fifteen years, taught him lessons he simply referred to as "The Information." Burroughs and two others formed a spiritual circle to practice the lessons provided by the mentor and distilled them into a "personal honor code" available to all people wishing to prepare for a time of great change.<br>The time is now at hand and Burroughs, along with thousands of others who have formed "Intenders Circles" throughout the world, is sharing a simple and powerful message: that which you are reaching toward is also reaching out toward you.<br>The practice is, literally, as easy as one, two, three: 1) say your intentions out loud daily, 2) go to an Intenders Circle, and 3) state that, in order for your intentions to manifest, they must serve the Highest and Best Good of the Universe, yourself, and everyone concerned.<br>Since there are no limits on what you can think about, there are no limits on what you can intend.</p><p>Tony Burroughs is a self-empowerment advocate and community maker whose work is defining the standard for the future. He has bridged the gap between the mainstream and the magical by co-founding The Intenders of the Highest Good, an intentional community dedicated to achieving the highest potential of the individual and of the community. This simple but practical empowerment technique successfully combines the Laws of Manifestation with an Intenders Circle so that people are able to express their intentions and gratitude and bring their desires into reality.</p><h2>Making Better Concrete: Guidelines for Using Fly-Ash for Higher Quality, Eco-Friendly Structures</h2><p><p>Why a book about concrete?

A museum or an amusement park? The oldest ballpark in the major leagues, the last of the single-deck theaters, Fenway Park has inspired more lavish praise and outrageous comparison than any American sports arena in history. With its ominous Green Monster, the lone red seat that marks Ted Williams&#39;s record-setting longest home run, the hand-operated scoreboard at the base of the Wall, the fishbowl-style luxury &#34;600 Club&#34; with the press box perched high above, and the Hall of Fame faces, who could mistake Fenway Park for any other? Beautifully illustrated with Stan Grossfeld&#39;s prize-winning color photography, and written with an obvious love of the place, including interviews with an illustrious list of fans, players, coaches, and celebrities, FENWAY: A BIOGRAPHY IN WORDS AND PICTURES showcases the grand old park and memorializes it for generations of fans to come.</p><p>A religious shrine or a giant pinball machine? Museum or amusement park? Historical or hysterical? These are just some of the puzzlers posed by <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Dan Shaugnessy in this lovely homage to the second oldest, single most complex ballpark in the majors. The answers are debatable. What remains absolute are the images Boston's Fenway Park has burned into the imaginations of the faithful and the faithless since the day it opened, a short week after the Titanic sank. <p> Shaugnessy and photographer Stan Grossfeld combine to offer an often-spectacular visual tribute that looks both back in time and into the heart of all the park's odd nooks, crannies, shadows, and hiding places. They go inside the hand-operated scoreboard on the fabled Green Monster. There's even a lovely picture of a pastoral Fenway covered in snow. Shaughnessy's text--"When they raze Fenway, it'll be like cutting down an old tree. Count the rings. There's one for each celebration and heartache suffered by Red Sox fans"--is affectionate and quite personal. He adds to it with a series of short, lyrical reminiscences from those who've mused about the field-- David Halberstam, Bob Costas, Stephen King, and Doris Kearns Goodwin--and those who've played on it: Don Zimmer, Bucky Dent, Dennis Eckersley, and Carl Yastrzemski. Fittingly, Ted Williams pens the foreward. The result of the amalgamation is an altogether splendid celebration of a landmark about to be pushed by progress into memory. --<i>Jeff Silverman</i></p>BOSTON GLOBE columnist Dan Shaughnessy is the author of the best-selling CURSE OF THE BAMBINO as well as AT FENWAY: DISPATCHES FROM RED SOX NATION and SEEING RED: THE RED AUERBACH STORY.</p><h2>Rediscovering Paul: An Introduction to His World, Letters and Theology</h2><p>For some of us, the apostle Paul is like a distant uncle. We've heard he's pretty important. We've read the good parts of his letters. But sometimes he comes across as prickly and unpredictable. Not someone you'd like to hang out with at a coffee shop. He'd raise his voice, try to convert the barista, and we'd want to slink out the back door. For a mid-afternoon latte, we'd prefer Jesus over Paul. But actually, this is the guy who, from Ephesus to Athens, was the talk of the marketplace and the raconteur of the Parthenon. Maybe it's time to give Paul a break, let go of some stereotypes and try to get to know him on his own terms. If that's where you are, <em>Rediscovering Paul</em> is your guide. This is a book that helps us find Paul again--holding forth in the marketplace of Corinth, working with a secretary in framing his letter to the Romans, or pastoring the messy emerging churches of Philippi and Thessalonica. Drawing on the best of contemporary scholarship, honed by teaching and conversing with today's students, <em>Rediscovering Paul</em> is a textbook that rises above the rest.</p><p>"It is unusual that Bob Dylan, Larry Norman and the movie <em>The Godfather</em> all make it into a book about Paul the apostle. But they do here! David Capes, Rodney Reeves and Randolph Richards have written an introductory textbook to Paul that attempts to place him with one foot firmly in his own world and the other squarely in today's. The authors correct a number of misconceptions about the world in which Paul lived and wrote, and help us as readers to come to terms with the significance of his letters and theology for our times. This book will serve as a useful introductory guide to undergraduates and seminarians alike." (Stanley E. Porter, president, dean and professor of New Testament, McMaster Divinity College, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada)<br><br>"A vast, sometimes overwhelming array of data and issues confronts today's student stepping into the study of Paul for the first time. Yet weaving together insights from recent research, <em>Rediscovering Paul</em> offers a helpful, accessible introduction to the rich tapestry of cultures, events, theology and mission that shaped the great apostle and his writings." (George H. Guthrie, Benjamin W. Perry Professor of Bible, Union University)<br><br>"Many people who think they understand Paul actually misunderstand him. Professors Capes, Reeves and Richards have given the beginning student of Paul a much-needed, readable and insightful entr�e into the apostle's social world, ministry, letters, theology and legacy. The Paul they help us rediscover speaks the gospel of Christ crucified and raised not only to the first century, but also to the twenty-first." (Michael J. Gorman, Dean, The Ecumenical Institute of Theology, and Professor of Sacred Scripture, St. Mary's Seminary &amp; University, Baltimore, Maryland)<br><br>"Several good textbooks cover the background, life, letters and theology of Paul at a seminary or graduate-school level, which some advanced college students can handle. But nothing currently in print accomplishes all of these tasks well, with the representative undergraduate as its primary target audience, at least not from an evangelical perspective. Capes, Reeves and Richards now admirably fill this gap, not only with excellent, readable content but also user-friendly sidebars explaining the significance for modern life of numerous ancient events and customs. At the same time, they teach us to think more like members of Paul's first-century Mediterranean audiences to interpret Paul's writings more accurately.

Remembering how much fun she had with the three trick-or-treaters who came by at Halloween, Little Witch grabs her bat and her cat and sets off to find them. But where do you find an astronaut, a pirate, and a devil when it's not Halloween? Little Witch and her flying broomstick go to great lengths and all the obvious places, but with no luck.

Opera paints the human passions with astonishing power and drama. This book, the first new, full-length, single-volume history of opera for more than a generation provokes in-depth discussions of many works by the greatest opera composers, from Monteverdi, Handel and Mozart, to Verdi and Wagner, to Strauss, Puccini, Berg, and Britten. There are lively discussions of opera&#39;s social, political and literary background, its economic circumstances and the almost continual polemics that have accompanied its development through the centuries. Abbate and Parker examine the problems that opera has faced in the last half century, when new works - which were once opera&#39;s life-blood - have shrunk to a tiny minority, have largely failed to find a permanent place in the repertoire. Yet the book&#39;s final message is one of celebration. Opera as an art form remains extraordinarily buoyant and challenging. It continues to transform people physically, emotionally, and intellectually, and to articulate human experience in ways no other art form can match. &#39;[T]his is the best single volume ever written on the subject, such is its range, authority and readability&#39; - Times Literary Supplement &#39;Their fantastically clear-sighted and down-to-earth history focuses on what opera is and was rather than what it should be or would like to have been.

He was renowned worldwide for his innovative fly patterns, his books, and his enormous influence in the world of fly fishing and fly tying. In this classic work on fishing for trout in the high-altitude lakes of the West, LaFontaine turns his considerable talents to this highly specialized but also endlessly absorbing aspect of fly fishing.<br> In characteristic form, LaFontaine tackles his subject with zeal, packing in loads of equipment, including scuba gear, to do his research. The chapters alternate between stories about the sheer fun of fishing mountain lakes with hardcore, how-to fishing lessons.<br> LaFontaine uses his quirky wit and iconoclastic vision to peel back the mysteries of this fishery, including distribution of fish, primary food sources, and feeding patterns. Other chapters cover seasons, weather, fly patterns, and even how to use pack animals to reach your high-altitude destinations. Gary distills this research into a captivating amalgam of hard information and entertaining anecdote.<br> FLY FISHING THE MOUNTAIN LAKES will make you think and make you laugh. And you might catch a few more trout on your next mountain lake expedition.<br> <br></p><p>Tired of squeezing in shoulder-to-shoulder amongst the horde of other fly-fishers at your usual tailwater? Go climb a mountain instead. In his primer on the joys of fishing mountain lakes, Gary LaFontaine reveals the tantalizing secrets behind such angling exotica as ice-out, floss blow lines, the rollover scud, and four-legged hiking companions (i.e., pack animals). If that's not enough to prime the calf muscles and fire the imagination, consider the possibility of lunker cutthroats cruising the shallows of a remote alpine lake, or perhaps a Hollywood-attired golden trout glinting in the sunlight as it rises for a bivisible. Sure beats tangling your line with some oaf on the San Juan. <p> The author of such thoughtful and innovative instructionals as <i>Caddisflies</i>, <i>The Dry Fly: New Angles</i>, and <i>Trout Flies: Proven Patterns</i>, LaFontaine is a trustworthy guide to the higher altitudes. <i>Fly Fishing Mountain Lakes</i> is more streamlined than those other tomes, but it still benefits from the author's patented M.O.: observe and adapt. There are chapters on tackle, fly selection, and stillwater tactics--and thankfully the wisdom (some of it fairly technical) is peppered with anecdotes, good humor, and log entries from the author's own expeditions. The main drawback is a cursory overview of how to choose a destination. Much of the fun--and skill--of fishing the high country is studying topographic maps and researching old fish-stocking plans. No angler, after all, wants to hike 10 miles cross-country to a lake brimming with stunted four-inch brookies. But that's a minor quibble. <i>Fly Fishing the Mountain Lakes</i> is an entertaining and eminently useful addition to the angling library. <i>--Langdon Cook</i></p>GARY LAFONTAINE was one of the best-known and most innovative fly fishermen and angling writers in the world.

Many in their Plymouth colony won&#39;t make it through the winter, and the colony&#39;s first harvest is possible only with the help of two friends, Samoset and Squanto. Richly detailed paintings show how the pilgrims lived after landing at Plymouth, through the dark winter and into the busy days of spring, summer, and fall. Culminating with the excitement of the original Thanksgiving feast, &#34;Three Young Pilgrims&#34; makes history come alive.</p><p>Cheryl Harness lives in Independence, Missouri.

As an author and illustrator, she is known for her engaging approach to history, seen in such books as <i>Our Colonial Year</i>; <i>Mary Walker Wears the Pants</i>;<i> Young Abe Lincoln</i>;<i> George Washington</i>;<i> Spymaster</i>; <i>Three Young Pilgrims, Ghosts of the White House</i>; and <i>Remember the Ladies.</i>Using the lives of three real children who traveled on the Mayflower and lived in the Plymouth Colony--Mary, Remember and Bartholomew Allerton--Harness focuses on their experiences and "adventures during one year, between the autumns of 1620 and 1621." She surrounds their story with the larger one of the Pilgrims' struggle for religious freedom and human survival, and invests these figures from the past with a vitality and accessibility that transcend the customary seasonal emphases. This is no sanitized interpretation: the death of the children's mother and her new baby is included, as are the illnesses and deaths of many of the other "Saints"--Pilgrims--and "strangers"--non-religious members of the settlement party. Nor is the historical information here confined to the well-paced, involving text; equally effective are the carefully researched watercolor, gouache and colored pencil paintings--possessed of a suitable rusticity, they expand the narrative with dramatic intensity. A generous inclusion of diagrams, charts and maps abounds with the kind of details and labels capable of mesmerizing youngsters for hours. This notable blend of fact and fiction deserves year-round popularity. Ages 5-10. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Month-By-Month Gardening in Missouri</h2><p>Never garden alone!

Swept along by the cascading advances of today&#x2019;s technology, most of us take for granted that progress brings improvement. Despite spectacular material advance, however, the evidence grows that we are failing to create a sustainable future for humanity. We are out of tune with the planet that nurtures us.</p><p>Technology itself is not the problem, as Whybrow explains, but rather our behavior. Throughout its evolution the ancient brain that guides us each day has been focused on short-term survival. But fortunately we are intensely social creatures. Without the caring behaviors that flow from intimate attachments to others, we would be relying on a brain that is only marginally adapted to the complexity of the problems we must now face together. Today we must grapple with survival, not in its immediacy but over the long term.</p><p>The first step in finding our way forward is to reexamine who we are as creatures of this planet. To this end, Whybrow takes us on a fascinating tour of self-discovery, drawing extensively upon his decades of experience as a psychiatrist and his broad knowledge of neuroscience and human behavior.</p><p>Illustrated throughout with engaging personal stories, the book&#x2019;s trove of cutting-edge science is enriched by philosophical, historical, and cultural perspectives. What emerges is a summons to rediscover the essential virtues of earlier nurturing, of mentored education, and an engagement with the natural world through curiosity and imagination.</p><p>Neuroscience can open the search for a better future. But technology alone will not save us. To achieve success we will need the strength and wisdom of our better nature as humane social beings.</p> 8 illustrations</p><p>Peter C. Whybrow, MD, is director of the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, Los Angeles. Born and educated in England, he is the author, among other books, of A Mood Apart and the award-winning American Mania: When More Is Not Enough.&#x201c;Though <em>The Well-Tuned Brain</em> is packed with powerful recent research, its punch comes from the philosophical meditation at its core. Peter Whybrow ponders how living our best lives can make the best world. This book is a courageous manifesto about human frailty that delineates the care with which we need to treat ourselves and those around us. We ignore its message at terrible personal and social cost.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew Solomon, National Book Award&#x2013;winning author of <i>The Noonday Demon</i> and <i>Far from the Tree</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As we face the biggest problems civilizations have ever confronted&#x2015;climate change above all&#x2015;it&#x2019;s crucial that we understand why our brains are being hijacked in the wrong direction. Peter Whybrow&#x2019;s book does exactly that, making it possible for us to summon the grace and will necessary to do the right thing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bill McKibben, author of <i>Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Combines gripping big themes with an abundance of fascinating stories. The big themes revolve around the collision between our ancient human habits, our human brains often operating on autopilot, and the seductive material success of our modern market economy. You&#x2019;ll find this book as rich and as thought-provoking as it is enjoyable.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jared Diamond, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> and <i>The World Until Yesterday</i></strong></p><h2>The Dream of a Ridiculous Man</h2><p>The story opens with the narrator wandering the streets of St. Petersburg. He contemplates how he has always been a ridiculous person, and also, how recently, he has come to the realization that nothing much matters to him any more. It is this revelation that leads him to the idea of suicide. The narrator of the story reveals that he had bought a revolver months previous with the intent of shooting himself in the head.</p><p>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (11 November 1821&#x2013; 9 February 1881) is considered one of two greatest prose writers of Russian literature, alongside close contemporary Leo Tolstoy. Dostoevsky's works have had a profound and lasting effect on twentieth-century thought and world literature. Dostoevsky's chief ouevre, mainly novels, explore the human psychology in the disturbing political, social and spiritual context of his 19th-century Russian society. Considered by many as a founder or precursor of 20th-century existentialism, his Notes from Underground (1864), written in the anonymous, embittered voice of the Underground Man, is considered by Walter Kaufmann as the "best overture for existentialism ever written."</p><h2>The Art of Robots</h2><p>The team behind the blockbuster animated hit <i>Ice Age</i>&#x2014;Twentieth Century Fox, Blue Sky Studios, and Academy Awardwinning director Chris Wedge&#x2014;joined forces with acclaimed children's author William Joyce to create another visually magnificent, animated classic in <i>Robots</i>.

A consummate professional? A bright star in the Hollywood universe? Yes, you could say all those things. Or you could just say that he was the little dog that could. The little dog that never took no for an answer. The little dog that never said, "I can't," but always, "why can't I?"</p><p>The story of Moose is a classic rags-to-riches story of how an average pound-bound puppy barked, jumped, and mugged his way up the ladder of success to become a major superstar. Not since Lassie has America cared so much about one of its four-legged creatures. At least, that's what Moose would say.</p><p>I would say that working with that dog has been a nightmare. I had to be at his beck and call, any time, day or night. You don't know what it's like to get a call at three o'clock in the morning because "someone" has something he wants to add to the Frasier chapter. Did he think I had no life of my own? Or that I slept by the telephone waiting for him to call? Yes, he did. Because, like most uber-stars, he thought the world revolved around him. From the moment I committed to working with him on this book, it's been nothing but Moose, Moose, Moose.</p><p>But I have to admit he's had a fascinating life. To be plucked out of obscurity and thrust into the limelight may be the dream of every actor in the world, but in reality it's more of a challenge than most people realize. It's hard not toget caught up in all the glitter and hype of Hollywood and completelylose sight of what's really important--family and friends. As egomaniacal as Moose is, he has never forgotten where he came from or taken for granted the fans that got him where he is today.</p><p>He's a complex guy--selfish and independent, demanding and feisty, impatient and intense, arrogant and stubborn, and strong-willed. But heis also loving, caring, thoughtful when he wants to be, charismatic, funny, charming, and above all loyal.</p><p>In short, Moose is a Jack Russell terrier with an attitude. Is there any other kind?</p></p><p>An enjoyable read for Eddie-the-dog fans, <i>My Life As a Dog</i> is full of the same snappy attitude that brought stardom to Moose on <i>Frazier</i>. Great photos, replies to a sampling of letters received by the popular canine, and an entertaining life history will supply you with the answers to every possible trivia question about this adorable Jack Russell terrier. What was his first professional job? How many children does he have? What was the name of the film that he and son Enzo acted in alongside Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane? It's all here, and all narrated by the king of cute himself. <p> Ever wondered why his tongue is always sticking out in that oh-so-elegant manner? Turns out he wore his teeth down from chewing too much as a puppy. You'll be relieved to learn that Frazier isn't really a dog hater--he gets along just fine with Eddie off-screen, and apparently his breath smells like popcorn. We won't spoil the rest of it for you--if you want to learn about the inspiration for that continual stare, or just what flavor of dog biscuits he's partial to, you'll just have to read it yourself! <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>Brian Hargrove got a BFA from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The figure in the spotlight fell and the coup-de-theatre had become murder. Could Inspector Alleyn believe Pastern had let hatred of his future son-in-law go too far? When Lord Pastern Bagott takes up with the hot music of Breezy Bellair and His Boys, his disapproving wife Cecile has more than usual to be unhappy about. The band&#39;s devastatingly handsome but roguish accordionist, Carlos Rivera, has taken a rather intense and mutual interest in her precious daughter, Felicite. So when a bit of stage business goes awry and actually kills him, it&#39;s lucky that Inspector Roderick Alleyn is in the audience. Now Alleyn must follow a confusing score that features a chorus of family and friends desperate to hide the truth and perhaps shelter a murderer in their midst.</p><p><p><strong>Ngaio Marsh </strong>(1895-1982), born in New Zealand, wrote over thirty detective novels. Many of her stories had theatrical settings, as her real passion was for the theater. She was both an actress and a producer and almost single-handedly revived the New Zealand public's interest in live theater. In 1966 she was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.</p>"It's time to start comparing Christie to Marsh instead of the other way around."--<i>New York magazine</i><br></p><h2>Selected Poems 1947-1995</h2><p>Celebrating the seventieth birthday of the acclaimed American poet, a collection of never-before-published poems and old favorites spans Ginsberg&#39;s full career and includes some of his earliest works, signature pieces, and recent gems.</p><p>Allen Ginsberg made his mark, along with Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder and others, in the Beat movement, a poetry of social protest that refused perceived elitist boundaries. Tortured by the paranoia and mental illness of his immigrant mother, and by his own homosexuality in a society that was homophobic, Ginsberg&#39;s early work was as much a measure of his self-loathing as his detestation of social hypocrisy and injustice. His poems reached depths of humiliation and shame that presaged a mental breakdown, followed by recovery with the help of Buddhist philosophy. His best poetry rises above both personal despair and political propagandizing with satiric comedy, and cheerful self-parody, and is most readily appreciated when read aloud. This volume includes sixty pages of songs, some written in collaboration with Bob Dylan, which are not included in his Collected Poems 1947-1980.<p>Allen Ginsberg was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as a winner of the National Book Award for Poetry. He was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1926, and died in New York City in 1997.</p></p><h2>The Witch Of Blackbird Pond</h2><p>An acceptable reading copy, with some creasing, tanned pages. Plastic cover secured with aged tape</p><p>Forced to leave her sunny Caribbean home for the bleak Connecticut Colony, Kit Tyler is filled with trepidation. As they sail up the river to Kit's new home, the teasing and moodiness of a young sailor named Nat doesn't help. Still, her unsinkable spirit soon bobs back up. What this spirited teenager doesn't count on, however, is how her aunt and uncle's stern Puritan community will view her. In the colonies of 1687, a girl who swims, wears silk and satin gowns, and talks back to her elders is not only headstrong, she is in grave danger of being regarded as a witch. When Kit befriends an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, it is more than the ascetics can take: soon Kit is defending her life. Who can she count on as she confronts these angry and suspicious townspeople? <p> A thoroughly exciting and rewarding Newbery Medal winner and ALA Notable Children's Book, Elizabeth George Speare's <i>The Witch of Blackbird Pond</i> brings this frightening period of witch hysteria to life. Readers will wonder at the power of the mob mentality, and the need for communities in desperate times--even current times--to find a scapegoat.

Fearless in her opposition to lynchings, Wells documented hundreds of these atrocities. Wells became a public figure in Memphis when, in 1884, she led a campaign against racial segregation on the local railway. In 1889, she became co-owner and editor of Free Speech, an anti-segregationist newspaper based in Memphis on Beale Street. She also published in 1892 her famous pamphlet Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All its Phases. This pamphlet, along with her 1895 The Red Record: Tabulated Statistics and Alleged Causes of Lynching in the United States, documented her research on and campaign against lynching. In 1892, Wells went to Great Britain at the behest of British Quaker Catherine Impey. An opponent of imperialism and proponent of racial equality, Impey wanted to be sure that the British public was informed about the problem of lynching. After her retirement, Wells wrote her autobiography, Crusade for Justice (1928). Her other works include Mob Rule in New Orleans (1900).</p><p>Ida Bell Wells-Barnett (July 16, 1862 &#x2013; March 25, 1931) was an African-American journalist, newspaper editor, suffragist, sociologist, and an early leader in the civil rights movement. She documented lynching in the United States, showing how it was often a way to control or punish blacks who competed with whites, often under the guise of rape charges. She was active in women's rights and the women's suffrage movement, establishing several notable women's organizations. Wells was a skilled and persuasive rhetorician, and traveled internationally on lecture tours.</p><h2>Quilt Designs in Cross-Stitch (An American Sampler 1989)</h2><p>The Vanessa-Ann Collection.

But&#x2014;who? In my case, not Uncle Evariste. No, he did the sensible thing. Certainly not my fellow clerks and scriveners. None of it was their fault. I&#x2019;m casting around trying to think of someone other than myself.</p><p>Ah. I have it. Of course. The bookseller. If he ever existed in the first place. But I know he did. Should I curse him? Or thank him for all that came later?</p><p>To begin, then, on a sparkling blue afternoon in our port city of Magenta. I had taken a stack of receipts and shipping records for deposit with Casa Galliardi, the merchant bankers. It was no more than a few hundred yards from my uncle&#x2019;s office and warehouse, but such errands took a long time. Instead of promptly going back, I would loiter at the docks.</p><p>Moored at the wharves or anchored in the harbor, there must have been anything and everything that could float: cargo vessels; often a galleon big as a house; long, slender craft with three-cornered sails; a flock of little fishing boats. Our Isle of Serrano was a horn of plenty, overflowing with fruits and vegetables to feed mainland Campania. But our real cash crop came from Eastern ports. Silk. Jade. Carpets. Cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg&#x2014;I could smell them in the air. Uncle Evariste imported and resold these precious goods. He did well. Except for me.</p><p>When he had nothing more urgent to do, he would yell. Usually on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. He was a methodical man.</p><p>&#x201c;Carlo, Carlo, what&#x2019;s to become of you?&#x201d; he would burst out. Then, once he got into the spirit of the occasion, he would pull his beard with one hand and fling the other heaven-ward.</p><p>&#x201c;Why? What have I done to be plagued with a thankless daydreamer? Eh? Eh? I&#x2019;m asking. You tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Truly, Uncle,&#x201c; I said, though his question was not specifically directed to me, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>I was, in fact, more or less grateful to him. He and my father had been partners until, years ago, a vicious fever took away my parents along with many of our islanders. Uncle Evariste gave me board and lodging; and, such as it was, my occupation in life.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve seen you&#x2014;don&#x2019;t think I haven&#x2019;t,&#x201c; he ranted on. &#x201c;Sitting with your nose in some book of rubbish. Like an idiot. Carlo Chuchio&#x2014;Carlo the jackass. The dimwit. Carlo the chooch.&#x201d;</p><p>Here, he used the vulgar street pronunciation of &#x201c;chuchio.&#x201d; He thrust his beard at me. &#x201c;Do you know? That&#x2019;s what they call you behind your back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes to my face,&#x201c; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep on like that,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll amount to&#x2014;to what? Nothing!&#x201d;</p><p>Then he would go off muttering to himself. And that was mainly all we had to say to each other.</p><p>Now, the bookseller. Yes, that day. On my long way back from Casa Galliardi, I left the quayside, the sailors bawling in every language, and wandered through the market square. My mouth watered at the mounds of blood oranges, lemons, figs, olives. The best on the island. (We sold the second best to Campania.)</p><p>Next to the melon vendor stood an open-air bookstall with an array of old engravings pinned to a length of clothesline. Shelves leaned every which way, with shabby volumes crammed one against the other. Surprisingly, I had never before noticed it. Naturally, I had to stop.</p><p>Rubbing his hands, the bookseller stepped over to me. A little man with a stringy beard, a narrow, beaky face. A total stranger.</p><p>&#x201c;My good messire,&#x201c; he began. &#x201c;And what does the worthy gentleman fancy?&#x201d;</p><p>He spoke with an unfamiliar accent. I said nothing. For one thing, I was taken aback&#x2014;but hardly displeased&#x2014;at being called a worthy gentleman. For another, I had no idea what I fancied.</p><p>&#x201c;A tractatus on mathematics? Military engineering? No? Geometry? Architecture? No, again?&#x201d; He gestured at the sagging shelves. &#x201c;Perhaps the art of writing love letters, with examples to be copied. Useful phrases for every circumstance, to woo your lady fair.&#x201d;</p><p>He drew closer, cocking his head, studying me like a tailor calculating my measurements for a suit of clothes.</p><p>&#x201c;No, messire, I see none that fits.&#x201d;</p><p>I was about to turn away when his eyes lit up. He snapped his fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. Exactly.&#x201d;</p><p>Without looking, he reached behind him and pulled a small, thick volume from a shelf. The leather cover was scuffed, the stitching had come loose. The pages were mottled and dog-eared, nearly falling out of the binding. He fondled it with obvious affection.</p><p>&#x201c;A curious collection of old tales. I promise you will find it most enjoyable.&#x201d;</p><p>He pressed the book into my hands. Truth to tell, I wasn&#x2019;t all that much interested. After a few moments, though, I was spellbound. I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes away. Leafing through, I saw these were tales of amazing voyages, carpets that flew in the air, caves of glittering treasures. If, at first, I had no idea what I fancied, I knew now. This.</p><p>The bookseller must have sensed my excitement. He beamed and bobbed his head. &#x201c;A gentleman of fine taste and judgment. A rare volume, messire. And what a joy to match the perfect book with the perfect reader. These days, alas, it seldom happens.</p><p>&#x201c;For you,&#x201c; he went on, &#x201c;I make a special price. Less than I paid. But, after all, what is profit?&#x201d; He sighed. &#x201c;And yet&#x2014;and yet I hate to part with it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t have to,&#x201c; I told him.</p><p>He blinked at me. &#x201c;Eh? Why so?&#x201d;</p><p>I answered simply and sadly that I had no money.</p><p>His smile collapsed. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the trouble with these young gallants,&#x201c; he muttered. &#x201c;Empty pockets. It&#x2019;s a contagious disease.&#x201d;</p><p>I would have given back the volume, but he raised his hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah&#x2014;no. You like it too well. I haven&#x2019;t the heart&#x2014;aie, my generous nature will be the ruin of me. So, so&#x2014;Keep it, then. Yours. Free.&#x201d;</p><p>I had to protest&#x2014;a little. Purely as a formality. My refusal was neither strong nor convincing. Especially since I did not loosen my grip on this prize and had no sincere intention of doing so. When he disregarded my feeble show of reluctance, I deluged him&#x2014;several times over&#x2014;with wholehearted thanks for his kindness.</p><p>&#x201c;That remains to be seen,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;Go away. Before I come to my senses and change my mind.&#x201d;</p><p>Never had I made the journey back to the office at such breathtaking speed. Not that I was eager to do my work. I could not wait to examine my gift more closely.</p><p>The copying clerks, Simone and Melchiorre, dutifully scribbling away, barely glanced at me. I climbed onto my stool, pushed aside the bills of lading, the manifests and inventories, and plunged into the book. It was even more thrilling than I&#x2019;d supposed.</p><p>To the shock and astonishment of my colleagues, I stayed perched at my desk until sundown. They left me still poring over the tales.</p><p>At dinnertime, with my prize tucked safely inside my jacket, I pleaded vaporish ailments, a headache, an upset stomach, and begged to be excused from the evening meal. Uncle Evariste, mumbling something like &#x201c;What a chooch,&#x201c; was glad enough to grant my request.</p><p>I bounded up to my quarters in the low-ceilinged attic, lit the candle on the table beside my cot, and flung myself onto the straw mattress. In case I had missed so much as a word here and there, I began reading again from the first page.</p><p>Later, Silvana, our housekeeper, worried I might be fatally ill or starving to death, carried in a tray of leftovers. Seeing me alive but preoccupied, she warned me to stop whatever I was up to or I would do myself a mischief, and went back downstairs.</p><p>I had never suffered from lack of appetite; nor been so caught up by tales of gigantic birds, genies popping out of lamps to grant every wish. How to choose between eating and reading? I resolved that knotty question by doing both at the same time.</p><p>The pages, however, kept falling loose. They soon parted company with the cracked leather binding. The spine had split down the middle. It was then I noticed something had been stuffed into it.</p><p>It was a rolled piece of parchment covered with crisscrossing lines and squiggles. A diagram? A map of some sort? But I saw no directions, no bearings. Curious, I laid aside the book to study it.</p><p>I realized I had been looking at the back of the sheet. When I turned the parchment over and smoothed it out, I saw indications of mountain ranges, rivers, towns.</p><p>At first, I judged it too vague to have any use or meaning. But, no, as far as it went, it was fairly precise. There was an inset drawn at one corner, an enlargement of a portion of the area. My heart began racing.</p><p>It showed, in some detail, what appeared to be a city of considerable size&#x2014;or what had once been a city. The sketch depicted only the ruins of a wall circling the jagged stump of a tower, perhaps a fortress, and the rubble of a central square. What set my heart pounding was a notation in a spidery, almost unreadable hand: &#x201c;Royal Treasury.&#x201d; That was enough to make my thoughts gallop as fast as my pulse. I had, by now, convinced myself this was a map of hidden riches. If my book was a treasure, I had found yet another treasure inside it.</p><p>But there was a difficulty.</p><p>Whoever drew the map had known the region very well; so well, indeed, he had not troubled to name the location. What city? What mountain range? What lake? What river? They could have been anywhere in the world.</p><p>My candle guttered out. I lit another. I tried to stay calm and make sense of what I was dealing with. My eyes fell on a single word squeezed onto the edge of the parchment.</p><p>T...</p></p><h2>Beginner&#39;s Guide to Bead Netting</h2><p>In this colorful and inspiring book, Madeleine Rollason shows you how to produce beautiful and imaginative designs using bead netting.

In this beautiful inquiry into time and its milestones, he shares his interest and insights with his readers. Refreshingly reasoned and absorbing, the book asks and answers the three major questions that define the approaching calendrical event. First, what exactly is this concept of a millennium and how has its meaning shifted? How did the name for a future thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ on earth get transferred to the passage of a secular period of a thousand years in current human history? When does the new millennium really begin: January 1, 2000, or January 1, 2001? (Although seemingly trivial, the debate over this issue tells an intriguing story about the cultural history of the twentieth century.) And why must our calendars be so complex, leading to our search for arbitrary regularity, including a fascination with millennia? This revised edition begins with a new and extensive preface on a key subject not treated in the original version.<br><br>As always, Gould brings into his essays a wide range of compelling historical and scientific fact, including a brief history of millennial fevers, calendrical traditions, and idiosyncrasies from around the world; the story of a sixth-century monk whose errors in chronology plague us even today; and the heroism of a young autistic man who has developed the extraordinary ability to calculate dates deep into the past and the future.<br><br>Ranging over a wide terrain of phenomena--from the arbitrary regularities of human calendars to the unpredictability of nature, from the vagaries of pop culture to the birth of Christ--Stephen Jay Gould holds up the mirror to our millennial passions to reveal our foibles, absurdities, and uniqueness--in other words, our humanity.</p><p>In this slender volume, Stephen Jay Gould addresses three questions about the millennium with his typical combination of erudition, warmth, and whimsy: As a calendrical event, what is the concept of a millennium and how has its meaning shifted over time? How did the projection of Christ's 1,000-year reign become a secular measure? And when exactly will the millennium begin--January 1, 2000, or January 2, 2001? <p> "Our urge to know is so great, but our common errors cut so deep. You just gotta love us," he states disarmingly in the preface. "And you gotta view misguided millennial passion as a primary example of our uniqueness and our absurdity--in other words, of our humanity." Gould's own curiosity about time and calendars was triggered by a 1950 issue of <i>Life</i> magazine, which cut the century in half with its evaluation of what had happened and its prediction of things to come, propelling his third-grade mind to the year 2000. In <i>Questioning the Millennium</i>, Gould promises to make no predictions (other than "an orgy of millennial books"); court no millennial epiphanies; and put forth no theories on the collective angst that typically accompanies a century's end. Instead, he answers the millennial questions which, for him, represent the intersection of undeniable reality (i.e., natural fact) and human interpretation. Gould's questions and learned answers, weaving many historical and scientific facts, are a loving inquiry into the human need for order in a vast and teeming universe.</p>"Gould poses three questions about the millennium in this delicious science-historical jeu d'esprit. . . . [This] may be the most enjoyable millennium book of the second millennium."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Booklist<p>"With a humorous Everyman approach, Gould juggles a mind-boggling array of various calendrical concepts as he explains why creating a reliable calendar was one of man's greatest struggles. Whether nailing down the precise date of the birth of Christ or airing his suspicion that God is a New York Yankees fan, Gould teaches rather than preaches."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Entertainment Weekly</p><p>"Gould eloquently charts . . . our stubborn, foolish, and occasionally glorious efforts, through science, religion, and philosophy, to continue to try to understand."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- New York Times</p><p>"In Questioning the Millennium, a collection of three witty and erudite essays . . . the noted paleontologist and science popularizer ponders the meaning of the upcoming calendar hoopla. As always, he is irreverent, idiosyncratic, and original."<br>-- San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle</p><p>"However out-of-left-field the subject, [Gould] still manages to charm with characteristically energetic, down-to-earth lucidity.

Gail Sher&#x2014;the first head baker of the celebrated Tassajara Bread Bakery in San Francisco&#x2014;created more than 100 clear, foolproof, and wonderfully varied recipes, divided into two basic categories: yeasted breads, ranging from white breads to whole-wheat, rye and specialty-flour breads (including recipes for rolls and buns as well as loaves); and quick breads, covering corn breads, spoonbreads, biscuits, tea cakes, batter breads, gingerbread, and muffins. Sher also covers every ingredient: grains, leaveners, salt, liquids, shortening, eggs, and "embellishments"; equipment; and most originally, methods and principles of breadmaking, with a special discussion of her ingenious "sponge" method, which no less a baker than Rose Levy Beranbaum (The Bread Bible) has praised as crucial to her own understanding of bread baking&#x2014;and which remains the most effective technique for creating flavorful bread. Over 100 drawings are also featured in this reset new edition of the all-in-one classic baking book.</p><p>GAIL SHER is a poet, psychotherapist, teacher, and writer whose books include The Intuitive Writer: Listening to Your Own Voice and One Continuous Mistake.

Sections include: <br><br>� The Power of a Positive You <br><br>� 5 Rules for Keeping Your Attitude at the Right Altitude <br><br>� <strong>More Power To You </strong>bulleted keys to successful thinking in each chapter <br><br>� The Power of Perspective<br><br>Nobody has more of a "can-do" attitude than Joyce Meyer.

Joyce&#39;s &#39;Enjoying Everyday Life&#39; radio and television programmes are broadcast around the world, and she travels extensively conducting conferences.Bestselling author and TV preacher Meyer takes a step beyond her bestseller Battlefield of the Mind. She offers a 12-step program to help readers conquer the negativity that naturally plagues the mind, leaving readers free to enjoy life and pursue their goals. Using themes from other books in her ample catalogue--worry, perseverance, managing emotions--Meyer breaks her suggestions into several digestible lists, backed by a "Power Pack" of Bible verses at the end of each chapter. She offers enthusiastic encouragement, but also requires action, here in the form of practice, discipline, and continual meditation on the 12 motivational thoughts. Critics of the positive thinking movement (Meyer obliquely acknowledges a debt to the pioneering Norman Vincent Peale) will continue to find downsides in this book, among them failure to sufficiently acknowledge the pain of suffering and an ignorance of intractable mental illness. Critics of Meyer will say she sounds like an infomercial ("You will see amazing results"). Yet her many fans will continue to appreciate her upbeat attitude and her ability to offer practical tips on the toughest topics. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of Time magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour - of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg - Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business - draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.</p></p><p></p><h2>Books and Naturalists (Collins New Naturalist Library, Book 112)</h2><p><p>Natural history, perhaps more than any other pursuit or study, has always relied heavily on books. Without their basic function of enabling the different kinds of animals and plants to be described and illustrated in adequate detail, the subject could never have come into being and gone on to thrive as it does today.</p> <p>Though met with mixed responses from scientists and naturalists across the centuries, believing the world around them was to be purely 'known' and not read, books on natural history have also come to incite passion and excitement in so many of their readers, and illustrations as much as text have helped to propel this. To have the world around us neatly categorized and named has, to an extent, made it a less daunting place in which to live.</p> <p>In the latest book from the highly acclaimed New Naturalist series, Dr. David Allen explores the world of nature publishing through the course of history, from its very early days in the dawn of publishing, through various significant new discoveries and into the birth of the New Naturalist series itself, highlighting the extraordinary personal stories behind many seminal works.</p> <p>Natural history is an area that is constantly developing and improving as our own understanding of the world develops, and as this fascinating book explores, publishing is always standing by to record and present this to its readers.</p></p><p><p>David Elliston Allen has had a specialist interest in the subject of this book for many years, the combined legacy of an undergraduate degree in anthropology, a period as an analyst of marketing surveys and co-authorship of two county Floras. A past President of the Botanical Society of the British Isles and of the Society for the History of Natural History, his books include &#x2018;The Naturalist in Britain: A Social History&#x2019;, first published in 1976.

Allen&#x2019;s book will serve both as an excellent introduction to this arcane and complex &#x2013; but fascinating &#x2013; history, and as a fitting addition to the library of anyone who loves natural history and the many books that record it.&#x2019;<br>The Times Literary Supplement</p> <p>Praise for the New Naturalist series:</p> <p>'The series is an amazing achievement.'<br>The Times Literary Supplement</p> <p>'The books are glorious to own.'<br>Independent</p></p><h2>Woman in the Mists: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa</h2><p>In December 1985 Dian Fossey&#39;s life came to a violent end when an unknown assailant split her skull open with her own bush-knife in the remote Parc des Volcans in Rwanda, 19 years after her arrival in Africa to study the rare mountain gorillas. She had established an international reputation, and had been accepted by the gorillas and become their champion. She had also made so many enemies that the Rwandan police scarcely knew where to begin their investigations. Fossey sacrificed her desire for children and family, risked her academic career, and endangered her health - and her life - by dedicating herself to the preservation of an endangered species. Her story, told in this book, is one of drama, ambition, heartbreak and brutality.</p><p>FARLEY MOWAT began writing for a living in 1949 after spending two years in the Arctic. He has lived in or visited almost every part of Canada and many other lands, including the distant regions of Siberia. He is author of 39 books, including People of the Deer , Never Cry Wolf , Sea of Slaughter , The Snow Walker , And No Birds Sang , and No Man&#39;s River . With sales of more than 14 million copies in 25 languages, Farley Mowat is one of Canada&#39;s most successful writers. He and his wife, Claire Mowat, divide their time between Ontario and Nova Scotia.Mowat, author of Never Cry Wolf and Sea of Slaughter, had access to Fossey's private papers; he has used excerpts from her diaries, amplifying the material with interviews from people who knew her wellfriends, enemies, colleagues, lovers. It is a gripping story from beginning to gruesome end, filled with drama, intrigue and love affairs. Fossey was an attractive, intelligent, determined woman; she was duped by some of the men in her life and, in the end, victim of ugly rumors and lies. Mowat redresses the record and offers a new theory about her murder in Africa in 1985. He believes that the two-year extension of her visa was Fossey's death warrant, that she had become a threat to Rwandans who wanted to exploit parkland for tourismnot a poacher, but a hired assassin killed Fossey. Her mercurial personality alone gives the book a wider audience than most in the nature-adventure genreand it is fitting that such a passionate defender of wildlife as Mowat write about her.

Many people know that the Norse gods fought against giants and were ultimately betrayed by Loki the trickster. The end of the world and the death of the gods in a grim battle called Ragnarok has also found its way into popular culture. Ideas taken from Norse mythology are frequently found in modern fantasy and science fiction &#x2013; such as elves, dwarfs and undead warriors rising from an unquiet grave, for example. Norse mythology is rich in adventure and ideas about creation, death and the afterlife. <i>Norse Myths</i> takes a wide-ranging approach, examining the creation stories of the Norse world, the monsters and the pantheons of the deities, including such figures as Heimdall, Freya and Baldr. It looks at the sagas and the Prose and Poetic Eddas, which tell of real and imagined people, featuring both heroic tales and humorous escapades. The book also examines how Norse myths were interpreted in a Christianized Europe and how their motifs influenced medieval German writers and, in turn, were used in the modern world in very different ways, by the likes of composer Richard Wagner and in the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. Illustrated with 180 color and black &amp; white artworks and illustrations, <i>Norse Myths</i> is an engaging and highly informative exploration of a rich mythology that still resounds today.</p><p>Martin J.

For the first time, the complete story of this epic, bloody war is now presented in a single, definitive volume.<br><br> In this inspired new work of history, Roger Ford describes the conflict in its entirety: the war in Mesopotamia, which would end with the creation of the countries of Iran and Iraq; the desperate struggle in the Caucasus, where the Turks had long-standing territorial ambitions; the doomed attacks on the Gallipoli Peninsula that would lead to ignominious defeat; and the final act in Palestine, where the Ottoman Empire finally crumbled.<br><br> Ford ends with a detailed description of the messy aftermath of the war, and the new conflicts that arose in a reshaped Middle East that would play such a huge part in shaping world affairs for generations to come. 48 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Roger Ford&#x2019;s work encompasses both narrative military history and that of military, aviation, and naval technology. He is the author of dozens of books in the field of military technology, including The Grim Reaper, a highly acclaimed account of the development of the machine gun, as well as a two-volume history of the Allied special forces in France during World War II, Fire from the Forest and Steel From the Sky. He lives in southern France.*Starred Review* Many of the seemingly chronic problems that plague the Middle East today can be traced back to WWI and the subsequent failures of the postwar settlements. Ford supplies an outstanding and comprehensive account of the military campaigns in the region while integrating them into the broader political interests and maneuvers of the great powers. While some historians viewed the struggle as a sideshow to the trench warfare on the western front, Ford convincingly asserts that the various fronts in the Middle East were an essential factor in the eventual Allied success. He begins with a description of the prewar milieu, as the Ottoman Empire, the &#x201c;Sick Man of Europe,&#x201d; continued to decline, giving rise to nationalist agitation and outside intervention. He proceeds to in-depth descriptions of the various campaigns, including the frustrating British effort in Mesopotamia, the disaster at Gallipoli, and the decisive victories in Palestine and Syria. In a fine postscript, Ford illustrates how and why the rivalries and designs of the victorious powers led to a &#x201c;peace&#x201d; agreement that virtually guaranteed continued instability and conflict. Enriching the narrative are interesting portraits of some of the key players, including T. E. Lawrence, Ataturk, General Allenby, and Lord Kitchener. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>The Path to Gay Rights: How Activism and Coming Out Changed Public Opinion</h2><p><strong>An innovative, data-driven explanation of how public opinion shifted on LGBTQ rights</strong>&nbsp;<br><br><em>The Path to Gay Rights</em> is the first social science analysis of how and why the LGBTQ movement achieved its most unexpected victory---transforming gay people from a despised group of social deviants into a minority worthy of rights and protections in the eyes of most Americans. The book weaves together a narrative of LGBTQ history with new findings from the field of political psychology to provide an understanding of how social movements affect mass attitudes in the United States and globally.&nbsp;<br><br>Using data going back to the 1970s, the book argues that the current understanding of how social movements change mass opinion&#x2014;through sympathetic media coverage and endorsements from political leaders&#x2014;cannot provide an adequate explanation for the phenomenal success of the LGBTQ movement at changing the public&#x2019;s views. In <em>The Path to Gay Rights</em>, Jeremiah Garretson argues that the LGBTQ community&#x2019;s response to the AIDS crisis was a turning point for public support of gay rights. ACT-UP and related AIDS organizations strategically targeted political and media leaders, normalizing news coverage of LGBTQ issues and AIDS and signaled to LGBTQ people across the United States that their lives were valued. The net result was an increase in the number of LGBTQ people who came out and lived their lives openly, and with increased contact with gay people, public attitudes began to warm and change. Garretson goes beyond the story of LGBTQ rights to develop an evidence-based argument for how social movements can alter mass opinion on <em>any</em> contentious topic.</p><p><b>Jeremiah J. Garretson </b>is Assistant Professor of Political Science at California State University-East Bay."This book is certain to be among the most important published this year. Support for gay rights has followed a different trajectory than support for any other minority groups rights, building more slowly but accelerating more steeply.In The Path to Gay Rights, Garretson has compellingly told the story that explains whya remarkable piece of scholarship." (Marc J. Hetherington,Author of Why Washington Won&#x2019;t Work: Polarization, Political Trust, and the Governing Crisis)<br><br>"Garretson seeks to complicate the mainstream narrative about what has caused the sea change toward the acceptance of the LGBTQ people in the United States...Will be of interest to political scientists and community organizers alike." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Quantitative data backs up the arguments of this serious social science book. It makes a significant contribution to the political science literature on LGBT studies by synthesizing and advancing the empirical arguments on the shift in opinion on gay rights in just a few generations." (Choice)<br><br>"This fine study examines how the change in public opinion took place over the years while looking at the ultimate causes of social change generally...An important addition to the LGBTQ bookshelf." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"The book's narrative is hopefulit's a story of how countless personal interactions and individual changes of heart, not elite opinion or legal mandates, drove one of the most remarkable attitudinal shifts in modern history." (<i>Reason</i>)<br><br>"The Path to Gay Rights examines why and how public support for gays and lesbians increased markedly in recent decades. Jeremiah J. Garretson explores the origins of this unusually rapid shift in public opinion, tracing it back to Americans increased contact with gay and lesbian individuals both directly and virtually through TV characters.The book provides a rich and layered account of events, activism, interest group activity, and political campaigns amplified by careful analysis of survey data, online searches, and Congressional votes. It provides invaluable insight into the dynamics of public opinion concerning gays and lesbians and social change more generally."

This cookbook proves the rice cooker--which tends to have a bad rap as a never-opened or oft-neglected wedding gift--can be surprisingly versatile: not only does it prepare your rice, it can be used for every dinner course--salad, soup, vegetable, entree, and even dessert. <p> There is a complete buying and cooking guide for the many rice varieties, as well as other whole grains such as barley, millet, wheat berry, and quinoa. Many of the recipes provide convenient alternative cooking methods for traditional dishes like Italian risottos (the Italian Sausage Risotto is wonderful). Hensperger and Kaufmann show the rice cooker can also work miracles for hot breakfast cereals and porridges with such recipes as Hot Fruited Oatmeal. Delightful main courses include Steamed Ginger Salmon and Asparagus in Black Bean Sauce, and the meal is done almost exclusively within the rice cooker for simple preparation and cleanup. The dessert section has many ideas beyond the expected Old-Fashioned Rice Pudding--the Poached Pears with Grand Marnier Custard Sauce is one elegant and sophisticated example. Both authors of this cookbook are seasoned food writers and this combined effort gives tasty, easy, and healthy recipes that will motivate you to use what has been, until now, an underutilized appliance. <i>--Teresa Simanton</i></p>from Publishers Weekly Although the electric rice cooker is an essential piece of equipment in most Asian kitchens, it hasn&#x2019;t found a home on as many American countertops as the authors believe it should; Hensperger (The Bread Bible) and Kaufmann (food editor of the San Jose Mercury News) are out to change this. Their thesis&#x2014;backed by 250 interestingly international recipes&#x2014;is that everything from Creamy Breakfast Oatmeal and lunchtime Old-Fashioned Black Bean Soup to dinner entrees such as Steamed Chicken Breast with Warm Mango Sauce and Coconut Rice can be made with no fuss in the rice cooker. Even risottos and polenta dishes no longer require tedious stirring. The authors begin by discussing the varieties of rice available (providing online and mail order sources), and move on to a comprehensive analysis of cookers ranging in price from $20 to $200. Each recipe suggests which kind of machine to use, but readers should be aware that not all dishes can be made in all machines. Concocting dim sum,! tamales, or steamed fish requires a simple rice cooker (the on/off variety), while chocolate rice pudding and applesauce call for a more sophisticated machine (the "fuzzy logic" kind). They conclude that this is the one appliance to invest in when kitchen space is at a premium, and they make a great case for the rice cooker&#x2019;s everyday versatility.</p><h2>The Heir Chronicles 3-book Box Set</h2><p>Three boys, three talismans, one destiny.&nbsp; In this page-turning trilogy, Cinda Williams Chima explores what it means to be different, what&#x2019;s worth fighting for, and what&#x2019;s worth dying for...<br><em><strong>THE WARRIOR HEIR&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</strong></em>Jack lives an unremarkable life in Trinity, Ohio.

Almost half a century after Lehmann&#39;s death in the village of Steerborough, a young woman, Lily, arrives to research his life and work. Poring over Klaus&#39;s letters to Elsa, Lily pieces together the story of their lives. And alone in her rented cottage by the sea, she begins to sense an absence in her own life that may not be filled by simply going home.</p><p>Esther Freud was born in 1963 and lives in London. Her previous novels are Hideous Kinky, which was made into a film starring Kate Winslet, Peerless Flats, Gaglow and The WildPainter Lucian's daughter, Sigmund's great-granddaughter and an accomplished novelist herself (Hideous Kinky), Freud invokes her father's family history in this splendidly written, evocative novel. Inspired by the letters of her grandfather, the architect Ernst Freud, she weaves an elegantly paced, double-stranded narrative set in the English coastal village of Steerborough. In the present, 20-something grad student Lily retreats to Steerborough for the summer with a bundle of letters that architect Klaus Lehman wrote to his wife, Elsa. Her story alternates with that of a group of German-Jewish emigres, including Klaus, Elsa and the deaf painter Max Meyer, who summer in Steerborough in 1953. While Lily pores over Klaus's adoring but paternalistic, bullying letters, she and her workaholic architect boyfriend Nick, living in London, are nearly incommunicado. "The men she knew didn't seem to feel the need to so utterly possess their women," Lily muses, somewhat regretfully. Between infrequent, strained visits from Nick, Lily makes a pretense at work, suns, swims and befriends the little girls next door&#x2014;and their virile, working-class father. Freud depicts postwar Steerborough from the point of view of Max and his hostess, Gertrude Jilks, an English child psychoanalyst and friend of his recently deceased sister, Kaethe. As Max hungers for the beautiful Elsa while mourning Kaethe and the immeasurable loss of his life and family in Germany&#x2014;a subtext Freud renders all the more powerful with slow, subtle revelations&#x2014;he paints every house in the village, creating a scroll that Lily will one day discover on exhibition. The novel's setting is smalltown, but its thematic scope is generous: from Old World jealous love to modern-day commitment issues, art, psychoanalysis, dislocation and yearning for home. Though the culmination of the love stories feels too deliberately plotted, Freud has constructed her novel with beautiful precision. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives in New York City.Starred Review. Having told the sad, extraordinary story of her maternal grandmother, the painter Margarett Sargent, in <i>The White Blackbird</i> (1996), Moore offers a painfully honest memoir of her father, Paul Moore (1919&#x2013;2003), the Episcopal bishop of the diocese of New York from 1972 to 1989. Educated at St. Paul's and Yale, Paul distinguished himself in battle as a marine on Guadalcanal during WWII; fathered nine children by his first wife, the vivacious Jenny McKean; and became an activist in the liberal social movements of the 1950s and '60s. He also had numerous clandestine affairs with men. While Paul's bisexuality did little harm to his professional career, it took a heavy emotional toll on his family, notably Jenny, who up to her death from cancer at age 51 confided to only a few intimates the underlying cause of the unhappiness in her marriage. The author, a poet and playwright, draws on letters between her parents, the reminiscences of friends (including a male lover of her father's) and her own experiences as her parents' oldest child coming of age in the '60s to create an indelible portrait of a charismatic religious leader who could be insensitive or even cruel to those who loved him most. At the dramatic heart of this engrossing family chronicle is the ultimately triumphant struggle of the daughter, who suffered her own sexual confusion and years of therapy, to reconstruct her father's personal history in an effort to understand his behavior and thereby forgive. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a &#34;brick wall.&#34; Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations), are not easily understood, and require time to assimilate. Since they are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students&#39; understanding of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject. Lay introduces these concepts early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, develops them gradually, and returns to them again and again throughout the text. Finally, when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more accessible. Students&#39; conceptual understanding is reinforced through True/False questions, practice problems, and the use of technology. David Lay changed the face of linear algebra with the execution of this philosophy, and continues his quest to improve the way linear algebra is taught with the new Updated Second Edition. With this update, he builds on this philosophy through increased visualization in the text, vastly enhanced technology support, and an extensive instructor support package. He has added additional figures to the text to help students visualize abstract concepts at key points in the course. A new dedicated CD and Website further enhance the course materials by providing additional support to help students gain command of difficult concepts. The CD, included in the back of the book, contains a wealth of new materials, with a registration coupon allowing access to a password-protected Website. These new materials are tied directly to the text, providing a comprehensive package for teaching and learning linear algebra.</p><p><p><b>David C.

Full color.</p><p>Gillian Kemp is a freelance writer and astrologer who first encountered gypsies while growing up in rural Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. Her horoscope columns appear regularly in Baby and Your Health magazines, and she is a frequent contributor to cable television. She lives in Buckinghamshire.Introduction <p>People have been telling fortunes since time began. You have the power within you to see your own future, or that of your friends, no matter what your age or circumstance. </p><p>The ancient art of divination is a vast subject, too large to be covered in its entirety here. This little book shows you simply how to develop your psychic and clairvoyant abilities, and to invoke them to tell fortunes using every-day household items such as tea leaves or coffee grounds, a pack of playing cards, a pair of dice, a bowl of water or ice, candles or apples. Most likely you already have the ingredients at hand, and because each method is easy to use, you can begin any time you like. Also included here are everyday omens and superstitions that have stood the test of time. </p><p>Once your mind is receptive to higher influences, you will find there is far more to life than just what meets the eye. You've probably already had the experience of knowing who is on the telephone before you pick it up to answer. Or perhaps you have thought of someone and then heard from that person or bumped into them, or had a hunch or a feeling that something would happen. Your intuition is the compass that will always point you in the right direction. The door is already open; dare you step through? </p><p>TUNING YOUR MIND </p><p>Clairvoyance is special sight (literally, it means "clear sight") that allows you to see the future in a crystal ball or a tea-cup. If you can think of a lemon, see its shape and color, cut it in half and smell its aroma in your mind, you have clairvoyant powers. If not, you can become clairvoyant by training your imagination to visualize an object or situation. </p><p>Psychics have the power to feel, such as divining by psychometry (below). You can encourage your psychic powers in a number of ways, often with the help of a friend. The more often you try these methods, the more accurate your predictions will be. </p><p>PSYCHIC POWERS </p><p>Try sensing a drawing. Begin by holding out your left palm, flat and face up. While you have your eyes closed, a friend should draw a shape in the air-either a heart shape, a square, a circle, a wavy line or a cross-about 30 mm above your palm. Your hallenge is to sense whi h shape they have drawn. </p><p>TELEPATHY </p><p>Telepathy is thought transference, or communication between minds using extrasensory means. </p><p>Take a deck of playing cards. Remove all the face cards so that you are left with numbers one to ten in each suit. Shuffle the remaining 40 cards (20 will be red and 20 black) and pass them to a friend. </p><p>The pair of you should then sit back to back. Ask your friend to remove the top card and telepathically convey to you the number on the card and the color of the card. The pair of you should continue until the pack has been exhausted. Again, the more often you try, the more accurate you will become. </p><p>PSYCHOMETRY </p><p>Psychometry is the divination of facts about a person via his or her possessions. </p><p>To intuit a friend's feelings or details from their past, present, or future, ask to hold an item of their jewelry, such as a watch or ring. Hold it with your eyes closed for a few moments. Because the item has absorbed your friend's aura-the distinctive energy emanating from their body-you should be able to make a prediction in only five minutes. </p><p>Another method is to hold to your forehead a letter or card someone has sent. You will detect their mood, character and surroundings in which the letter was written.</p></p><h2>Appleby and Honeybath</h2><p>Sir John Appleby, retired Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, and artist Charles Honeybath join forces to investigate a murder--and mysterious disappearance of the corpse from a locked room--at the home of Terence Grinton</p><p>Born in Edinburgh in 1906, the son of the city&#39;s Director of Education, John Innes Mackintosh Stewart wrote a highly successful series of mystery stories under the pseudonym Michael Innes.Innes was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he was presented with the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and named a Bishop Frazer&#39;s scholar. After graduation, he went to Vienna to study Freudian psychoanalysis for a year and following his first book, an edition of Florio&#39;s translation of &#39;Montaigne&#39;, was offered a lectureship at the University of Leeds. In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick, a doctor, and they subsequently had five children including Angus, also a novelist.The year 1936 saw Innes as Professor of English at the University of Adelaide, during which tenure he wrote his first mystery story, &#39;Death at the President&#39;s Lodging&#39;. With his second, &#39;Hamlet Revenge&#39;, Innes firmly established his reputation as a highly entertaining and cultivated writer. After the end of World War II, he returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen&#39;s University, Belfast, where in 1949 he wrote the &#39;Journeying Boy&#39;, a novel notable for the richly comedic use of an Irish setting. He then settled down as a Reader in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he retired in 1973.Innes&#39;s most famous character is &#39;John Appleby&#39;, who inspired a penchant for donnish detective fiction that lasts to this day. His other well-known character is &#39;Honeybath&#39;, the painter and rather reluctant detective, who first appeared in 1975 in &#39;The Mysterious Commission&#39;.The last of the Innes novels, &#39;Appleby and the Ospreys&#39;, was published in 1986, some eight years before his death in 1994. His work is still very highly regarded and &#39;Appleby&#39;s End&#39; and &#39;The New Sonia Wayward&#39; were chosen by H.R.F. Keating as being amongst the best 100 crime novels ever written. The &#39;Times Literary Supplement&#39; said of him: &#39;A Master - he constructs a plot that twists and turns like an electric eel: it gives you shock upon shock and you cannot let go.&#39;<p>'Expect vintage ingenuity, well-tempered jokes, unruffled prose.

In A Pot O&#39; Gold, noted writer Kathleen Krull and beloved illustrator David McPhail bring this legacy to life. Created for families, this anthology compiles classic and rare examples of Irish culture including stories, poems, songs, recipes, and even a little blarney. From legends of leprechauns and fairies to the classic poetry of Yeats and Joyce, this treasury is a perfect way for anyone to share the wonders of Ireland.</p><p>Kathleen Krull is an acclaimed author of the popular &#x201c;Lives of&#x201d; nonfiction series. She is also the author of <i>Songs of Praise; Gonna Sing My Head Off!: American Folk Songs for Children; Lives of the Musicians; M Is for Music;</i> and <i>The Book of Rock Stars.</i> She is married to illustrator Paul Brewer.Gr. 4-8. Just in time for St. Patrick's Day, Krull has gathered together James Joyce and William Butler Yeats, the children of Lir and Oscar Wilde's Star-Child, Irish curses and folk cures and riddles, blessings and battle cries. Nor has she neglected limericks; Saints Patrick and Bridget; herring, potatoes, butter; or the man who had no story. It's a little breathless, although one can hardly fault her expansive purview; she even includes the origins of the Blarney stone. This is a pretty book, populated with fairies, leprechauns, and selkies and decorated with knotwork borders. McPhail has captured the saturated greens of Ireland in all their misty, moist glory, and his figures range from the marvelous portraits of the Traveling Men of Ballycoo to the plump and toothy farmers of Wheatlet, Son of Milket. The introduction and appended source material are useful, as are Krull's general headings, such as The Sea, The Music, The Scholars, and The Land. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He was awarded the Pritzker prize in May 2002 and is one of only seven recipients of the prestigious Alvar Aalto Medal. This volume is an up-to-date examination of Murcutt&#39;s work. Full-colour photography, much of it supplied from the architect&#39;s own private collection, and a comprehensive selection of drawings and concept sketches, are complemented by Glenn&#39;s own notes, and the commentary of internationally recognised architectural editors, Professor Haig Beck and Jackie Cooper. This book explores the buildings and projects drawn from a wide variety of contexts: coastal, mountainous, tropical and desert, and urban. Glenn Murcutt has also been awarded the Thomas Jefferson Medal for Architecture, the Keneth F. Brown International Award for Architectural Culture in the Asia Pacific region, and was awarded an International Honorary fellowship from the Royal Institute of Canadian Architects.</p><p>This book is a collaboration between Glenn Murcutt and internationally recognised architectural editors, Professor Haig Beck and Jackie Cooper. Book design by Garry Emery Design.Recipient of the 2002 Pritzker Architectural Prize, Murcutt is noted as Australia's chief exponent of sustainable and site-sensitive buildings. Working alone, as the title suggests, he created an original Australian architecture, characterized by the quality of the outback landscape. His buildings have evolved from the work of Mies van der Rohe (e.g., Mies's Crown Hall at the Illinois Institute of Technology), as seen in structures dating from the Laurie Short House of 1973 to the more expressive Magney House of 1985. Written by architecture critics Haig Beck and Jackie Cooper and divided into three sections-theory, practice, and technique-the volume begins with a series of brief essays, including one by Murcutt himself, on the technical, material, and aesthetic aspects of the work; oddly, none of these essays acknowledges the architect's obvious debt in his early work to Mies. In the middle section, 23 designs, illustrated with color and black-and-white photographs, are presented with brief, sometimes overly promotional descriptions and more insightful analyses by the architect. In the final section, a series of highly informative sketches, drawings, and construction details documents each of the same designs. Complementing E.M. Farrelly's more concise but ultimately more satisfying Three Houses: Glenn Murcutt, this volume is recommended for larger architecture collections.<br><i>Paul Glassman, New York Sch. of Interior Design Lib., New York</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>High Profile</h2><p>The murder of a notorious public figure places Paradise, Massachusetts, police chief Jesse Stone in the harsh glare of the media spotlight. <br><br> When the body of controversial talk-show host Walton Weeks is discovered hanging from a tree on the outskirts of Paradise, police chief Jesse Stone finds himself at the center of a highly public case, forcing him to deal with small-minded local officials and national media scrutiny. When another dead body-that of a young woman-is discovered just a few days later, the pressure becomes almost unbearable. <br><br> Two victims in less than a week should provide a host of clues, but all Jesse runs into are dead ends. But what may be the most disturbing aspect of these murders is the fact that no one seems to care-not a single one of Weeks's ex-wives, not the family of the girl. And when the medical examiner reveals a heartbreaking link between the two departed souls, the mystery only deepens. <br><br> Despite Weeks's reputation and the girl's tender age, Jesse is hard-pressed to find legitimate suspects. Though the crimes are perhaps the most gruesome Jesse has ever witnessed, it is the malevolence behind them that makes them all the more frightening. Forced to delve into a world of stormy relationships, Jesse soon comes to realize that knowing whom he can trust is indeed a matter of life and death.</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.What's up with Police Chief Jesse Stone? In the latest book in the Stone series, Jesse gets his new girlfriend, the funny, likable Sunny Randall, to babysit for his sourpuss ex-wife, Jenn, while he tries to figure out who killed a high-profile radio host. When is Jesse going to ditch that ex-wife and get on with the obvious? This is one of the better Stone novels, the second in the series, and Scott Sowers gives Stone just the right mix of humor and despair. We're also glad to see that Molly Crane and Suitcase Simpson are evolving into regular supporting characters.

When the publication is suddenly shut down, the colourful staff, who have become an extended family for Billie, must pick up their lives and move on. Not Billie, though. She is offered a new job: staying behind in the magazine's deserted downtown mansion offices to uphold the "Delicious Guarantee"--a public relations hotline for complaints and recipe inquiries--until further notice. What she doesn't know is that this boring, lonely job will be the portal to a life-changing discovery.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Delicious!</i> carries the reader to the colourful world of downtown New York restaurateurs and artisanal purveyors. And from the lively food shop in Little Italy where Billie works on weekends to a hidden room in the magazine's library where she discovers the letters of Lulu Swan, a plucky twelve-year-old, who wrote to the legendary chef James Beard during World War II. Lulu's letters lead Billie to a deeper understanding of history (and the history of food), but most important, Lulu's courage in the face of loss inspires Billie to come to terms with her own issues--the panic attacks that occur every time she even thinks about cooking, the truth about the big sister she adored, and her ability to open her heart to love.</p><p>RUTH REICHL was Editor-in-Chief of <i>Gourmet</i> magazine for ten years. She lives in New York City with her husband, son, and two cats.Eleven Years Later<br><br>When Jake Newberry asked me to cook for him, I froze.<br><br>&#x201c;Something wrong?&#x201d; He swept a strand of silver hair out of his eyes and gave me his famous cool blue stare.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not applying for a position in the test kitchen.&#x201d; I tried to keep the disappointment from my voice; the job had sounded so perfect. &#x201c;I thought you were looking for a new executive assistant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am.&#x201d; Then he added, &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t anybody tell you I ask every candidate to cook for me?&#x201d;<br><br>How had I missed that?<br><br>Jake reached down and patted the big yellow dog at his feet; the dog wriggled with pleasure, and I found that oddly reassuring. &#x201c;Look, Billie.&#x201d; Jake offered an encouraging smile. &#x201c;You seem like a good fit for Delicious! You worked on The Daily Cal. It sounds like you know your way around a kitchen. And you&#x2019;re even willing to leave school to take the job. I like that; it shows how much you want it.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d spent hours working on an explanation for dropping out; it had never crossed my mind that he&#x2019;d consider it a plus. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve said all the right things.&#x201d; He looked down at the pile of manuscripts on his desk, and when he looked up again, his smile was crooked. &#x201c;You Googled me, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would you want an assistant who didn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good answer. But that just proves my point. I don&#x2019;t find interviews all that revealing.&#x201d;<br><br>Every article I&#x2019;d read about Jake mentioned that he was a non-corporate guy, which was one of the reasons I&#x2019;d applied for the job. Working at Delicious! sounded like joining a club, entering a little world of its own, and that&#x2019;s exactly what I wanted. Needed. I&#x2019;d spent hours preparing for this interview, studying Jake, chasing down every detail. Now it appeared that hadn&#x2019;t been enough.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with interviews?&#x201d; I was playing for time. I really didn&#x2019;t want to cook.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it obvious?&#x201d; He was truly great-looking; the photographs captured his all-American looks, but they didn&#x2019;t catch the humorous way his lips turned up or the watchful intelligence in his eyes. &#x201c;You tell me you love the book, but, then, you&#x2019;re hardly going to say you hate it.&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;d lost me. Book? I had no idea what he was talking about.<br><br>&#x201c;Ha! Another piece of the puzzle slides into place. You don&#x2019;t know much about magazines, do you? In this business, magazines are always called &#x2018;books.&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t know why. What I do know is that every writer who comes for an interview is madly in love with this book. Then I ask what they&#x2019;re reading, and they serve up the usual suspects: The New Yorker, and the most challenging bestseller on the current list.&#x201d; <br><br>He pointed an ebony letter opener at me. &#x201c;I have to admit, throwing Brillat-Savarin into the mix was a clever move on your part; nobody&#x2019;s ever come up with that before.&#x201d;<br><br>Not all that clever: It hadn&#x2019;t taken much to find out he&#x2019;d written his college honors thesis on the great French gastronome.<br><br>Jake was studying me, and I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering if he&#x2019;d be easier on me if I were one of the pretty girls, or at least a bit more stylish. Aunt Melba had insisted that I buy a black skirt and a white shirt, but I hadn&#x2019;t bothered trying them on and the skirt was a little too short; now I tugged at it, trying to edge it closer to my knees. But it turned out Jake wasn&#x2019;t concerned with the way I looked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to figure out if you knew I&#x2019;d ask what you had for dinner last night.&#x201d;<br><br>It had been a lucky guess, but if I were the editor of a food magazine, that&#x2019;s a question I&#x2019;d be asking. So I Googled around and discovered that Jake had a passion for Japanese food. Then I found some obscure new place in the East Village specializing in Kitakata ramen and went in for a big bowl of clear fragrant broth filled with broad, chewy noodles. <br><br>&#x201c;Sounds great!&#x201d; he said, when I described the tiny restaurant and the eccentric chef who ran it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never heard about that place, and I can&#x2019;t wait to try it. Thanks. The thing is . . .&#x201d; He stopped for a moment to let a noisy truck go by. Delicious! occupied a grand old mansion, and on this hot September morning Jake had all the windows open. I looked around, noting what a mess the place was; there were so many stacks of manuscripts, it had been hard to find a place to sit down. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve learned about you: You do your homework. That&#x2019;s good. But all it really tells me is that you&#x2019;re smart and you want the job. We could talk all day and I&#x2019;d still have no idea if you&#x2019;re right for Delicious! But cooking&#x2019;s different; it doesn&#x2019;t lie. Is this a problem? Just humor me, okay.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no question mark on the end of that last sentence. If I wanted to work for Jake Newberry, I was going to have to cook.<br><br>Why hadn&#x2019;t I anticipated this? Because there was a problem: These days, simply thinking about cooking could bring on a panic attack. <br><br>Already I felt the clammy sweat popping out all over my body. Not now! I thought, willing myself to stand up, reminding myself to breathe. &#x201c;Anticipatory panic is the worst part,&#x201d; the therapist had said, and anxiety was pouring over me, making me woozy, as I followed Jake out of his office.<br><br>I tried to concentrate on the dog, who was running before us, jauntily waving his tail. In that moment I would have given anything to be him, to be so carefree. Go away! I pleaded with the panic, but now it entered me, expanding like a huge balloon, filling my body with agitation. My hands were shaking and the nausea was coming on, but Jake didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m always eager to find out what people will make for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gin--&#x201d; I began, grateful to be talking. It might help. But Jake waved me quiet.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, don&#x2019;t tell me. I like to be surprised.&#x201d;<br><br>I followed him up the stairs, so focused on the panic that I barely registered the graceful carved oak banisters and soft wooden floors. Concentrate on the recipe, I told myself, trying to repeat the ingredients in my head: oranges, cardamom, pepper, sour cream. The words were slightly soothing; maybe it would be okay. But then we were at the kitchen and Jake was opening the door. The scent of sugar, flour, and butter wafted toward me, and it was so familiar that I felt the blood rush from my face as the dizziness claimed me. The panic was inside, choking me, and outside too, a great wave crashing over me. <br><br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Jake&#x2019;s hand was on my arm. I knew I&#x2019;d gone white.<br><br>&#x201c;Fine. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; I put my hand out and grabbed the counter, trying to steady myself. From somewhere far away I heard Jake say, &#x201c;Okay, then. This is Maggie, our executive food editor. She&#x2019;ll make sure you&#x2019;ve got everything you need.&#x201d; Then he was gone.<br><br>All I wanted was to lie down on the cool floor, but I glanced up, trying to focus on the woman in front of me. She was old and painfully thin, with a straight nose and short black hair that looked as if she&#x2019;d chopped it off with a carving knife. She glared at me and muttered, just loud enough for me to hear, &#x201c;Why&#x2019;s Jake wasting my time? He&#x2019;ll never hire her.&#x201d;<br><br>Her unexpected meanness was like an electric shock, and it jerked me backward, jolting me into the moment. The effect was so immediate and so strong that the dizziness receded. It was like a miracle; I almost laughed. What was the worst thing that could happen? I&#x2019;d faint? Scream? Make some kind of fool of myself? I straightened up, looked her in the eye, told her I&#x2019;d need ginger, eggs, and oranges, and began ticking off the spices. She silently pointed to the refrigerator, the cupboard, the spice cabinet--staccato little jerks, as if she begrudged me every motion. The blood began to return to my head, and now I could feel the sweat drip down my face. I swiped at it with a paper towel when Maggie&#x2019;s back was turned. Then I opened the refrigerator and reached in, grateful for the rush of cold as I grabbed the eggs. The nausea was still there, but it was bearable now, and the departing panic had left relief in its wake, so strong it felt almost like elation. I&#x2019;d have a terrible headache later on, but I was going to get through this. <br><br>Maggie stomped off to the next counter, where a tall, older cook was rolling out pasta. The room was crowded--at least eight other cooks were in there--and the scent of baking cakes, roasting meats, and caramelizing onions filled the air. I gathered my ingredients and began to relax into the rhythm of the kitchen, slowly slipping into that flow where I was all alone. I grated orange peel, concentrating on the way the cool oil felt on my fingertips. I picked up a knob of ginger, losing myself to the rain-forest fragrance as I slowly shredded it with my knife. The scents swirled around me: cinnamon, cardamom, pepper, and clove.<br><br>Captured by the cooking, I picked up the pace, my spoon ringing against the bowl, my body vibrating to the familiar moves. I was so into sifting flour, greasing pans, and pouring batter that I didn&#x2019;t even realize I was talking as the cake went in the oven.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;No earthquakes now&#x2019;?&#x201d; Maggie&#x2019;s voice was belligerent. &#x201c;What the hell does that mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a California thing.&#x201d;<br><br>She sniffed derisively and stuck out her sharp chin. She seemed to be searching for a cutting remark when someone shouted, &#x201c;Taste!&#x201d;<br><br>The word reverberated through the room, galvanizing the cooks. They all dropped what they were doing and went charging toward the sound, forks held out before them, like knights heading into a joust. They descended on a roast one of the cooks had just pulled from the oven, each jockeying for the first forkful. There was a moment of silence as they stood chewing, then a sudden rush of words as they deconstructed the dish.<br><br>&#x201c;Needs more salt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Reminds me of that Paula Wolfert dish, the one with warka.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;d you use achiote?&#x201d;<br><br>Ten minutes later, they were still talking. I opened my oven door, and as the carnival scent of gingerbread came spilling out, they all looked toward me before resuming the conversation.<br><br>I turned the cake out of the pan and let it cool for a few minutes. I had just finished glazing it when Maggie stalked over. &#x201c;How long do you let it cool?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I like to eat it while it&#x2019;s still a little warm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Taste!&#x201d; she bellowed. I jumped back as the outstretched forks came rushing toward me.<br><br>&#x201c;It smells incredible,&#x201d; said one of the cooks.<br><br>Maggie, a practiced jouster, shoved his fork aside. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the first bite,&#x201d; she said, lopping off a chunk. She put it in her mouth and her lips twisted, as if she&#x2019;d swallowed a mouthful of vinegar. For a minute I thought she hated it. But then she said, reluctantly, &#x201c;Oh, God, this is fantastic. Jake&#x2019;s going to love it.&#x201d;<br>Spring Cheese<br><br>Dear Genie,<br><br>It was the gingerbread, of course; when Jake tasted it, he said anyone who could turn the world&#x2019;s most banal cake into something so compelling--he actually used that word--belonged at Delicious! He said he had to hire me if only to get the recipe. <br><br>As if I&#x2019;d give it to him! <br><br>Everything&#x2019;s happened so fast. Two weeks ago I was heading back for senior year, and now I&#x2019;ve got a job in New York, an apartment, a whole new life. If I let myself think about it, I get terrified, so it&#x2019;s a good thing I&#x2019;ll be busy: Jake said I&#x2019;ll sometimes have to work till after midnight. And the pay&#x2019;s so low. Dad says he&#x2019;ll cover my first year&#x2019;s rent, which is pretty serious, considering how much he hates me dropping out of school. And how much he&#x2019;s going to miss me. Aunt Melba keeps texting me, reminding me to call him. She thinks he&#x2019;s going to take this hard, but, then, she&#x2019;s always worrying about Dad. <br><br>I found the most incredible place, a fifth-floor walk-up on the Lower East Side. It&#x2019;s like the place I&#x2019;ve always dreamed of, so perfect I sometimes think I must have conjured it from my imagination. It&#x2019;s tiny, but there&#x2019;s tons of light, and it&#x2019;s in a great old neighborhood. If I keep the windows open, I can hear people&#x2019;s voices as they walk down the sidewalk, and if they&#x2019;re loud enough I catch intriguing little snatches of conversation. It goes on all day and all night; there&#x2019;s always something happening on Rivington. I love that. <br><br>My first night here, I went out at midnight--midnight!--to grab a bite at the little Chinese place on the corner. Then I went to the bookshop. Even that late at night, it was filled with people who looked like they led interesting lives. <br><br>I just wish you were here to share this. I feel so lonely. And then there&#x2019;s the question of clothes. I&#x2019;m heading off to my first day of work, and I&#x2019;m hopeless. All those mornings I watched you getting dressed--if only I&#x2019;d paid attention. <br><br>Miss you. <br><br>xxb<br><br>Stately, gracious, old, the Timbers Mansion seemed to soak up all the sunshine on the street. I walked slowly up the soft stone steps, taking in the worn bricks and faded marble columns. A hundred years ago, in 1910, when Delicious! magazine moved in, Greenwich Village must have been full of houses just like this, but now the mansion was the last one standing on this narrow tree-lined street.<br><br>Inside, the high-ceilinged lobby was dark and cool. The guard at the antique desk glanced up. &#x201c;First day, right?&#x201d; He waved me toward the staircase. &#x201c;Jake&#x2019;s expecting you. Second floor.&#x201d;<br><br>The day of my interview, I&#x2019;d been too nervous to notice much, but now I looked around, taking in the details. How amazing to be working in this gorgeous old house, surrounded by marble, carved oak, and chandeliers. There must be a fireplace in every room, and ancient windows with wavy handblown panes captured the sun and drew it inside.<br><br>Jake was waiting on the second floor beneath a silver chandelier. His dog was there too, leaping ecstatically to greet me as if I were his favorite person in the world. I reached down to pat him, but he jumped up, put his paws on my chest, and tried to lick my face. I laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;Good thing you like dogs.&#x201d; Jake pulled him down. &#x201c;That temp they sent was terrified of Sherman.&#x201d; He tugged gently on the dog&#x2019;s silky ears. &#x201c;But you didn&#x2019;t think much of her either, did you, boy? The woman was a disaster. Poor Billie&#x2019;s got no idea what a mess she&#x2019;s walking into.&#x201d;</p><h2>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</h2><p>Softbound edition.</p><p></p><h2>Modern Fourier Analysis 2nd Second edition byGrafakos</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

The book covers the period of early canonical literature with examples of its philosophically relevant ideas, followed by the principal philosophical concepts of systematic Sravakayana Buddhism. In the main part of the book, Frauwallner presents the first survey of the development of the philosophical systems of Mahayana Buddhism. He was well aware of the limitations in presenting only the Buddhist philosophy of the &#34;classical&#34;, i.e., the systematic period, and does not seem to have been ready to add the philosophically creative new postsystematic tradition of Buddhist epistemology and logic, a major subject of his subsequent years of research. Frauwallner&#39;s way of translating was straightforward: to remain as close as possible to the original text while presenting it in a clear and readable way in order to convey an accurate impression of its meaning. For technical terms in the source materials he maintained a single translation even when various meanings were suggested. For clarity regarding such variations of meaning he relied on the context and his explanation. The same approach was taken by the translator of the present book. Although his translation attempts to be faithful to the 1994 edition of Die Philosophie des Buddhismus, he inserted helpful additional headlines into the text and considerably enlarged the index. All other additions by the translator are given within square brackets. Besides this, he created an Appendix, which contains one of Frauwallner&#39;s more important articles &#34;Amalavijnana and Alayavijnana&#34; (1951) to complement the long Yogacara section of the book, a bibliography of selective publications after 1969. The URLs for many of the source materials were also conveniently provided.</p><p>Prof. Erich Frauwallner, born December 28, 1898, was appointed extraordinary professor of Indology and Iranian Studies August 1939 at Vienna University and full professor in 1960 at the newly opened Institute of Indology. He was not only widely acknowledged throughout the international scholarly community for his numerous path breaking studies and the History of Indian Philosophy but was also fascinating and motivating teacher. He died on July 4, 1974.</p><h2>Cities in Flight: They Shall Have Stars; A Life for the Stars; Earthman Come Home; The Triumph of Time</h2><p>&#34;James Blish has structured an entire universe in which mankind is no longer bound to the Solar System, but has become both conqueror and victim of the stars.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Ancient Texans: Rock Art and Lifeways Along the Lower Pecos</h2><p>Reconstructs the life of the prehistoric inhabitants of Texas and describes Texas archaeological efforts</p><p></p><h2>Timeless Masterpiece American Brass Dial Clocks</h2><p>This beautiful book, Timeless: Masterpiece American Brass Dial Clocks by Frank L.

Bad turns to worse when Dienwald de Fortenberry, the desperately poor but spirited "Rogue of Cornwall," seizes the wool shipment and Philippa becomes his prisoner. The young woman's spinning and weaving skills, as well as her ability to read and calculate, soon earn her the household's esteem and the position of steward, while her beauty and strong streak of sheer devilment capture Dienwald's affection, as he earns hers. Yet their happiness is threatened when Sir Walter de Grasse, Dienwald's greatest enemy, learns a secret about Philippa's past, a secret that not even she knows but that can change both her and Dienwald's future. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The World According to Breslin</h2><p>A collection of articles from one of America&#39;s key columnists features Breslin&#39;s commentary on strife in Northern Ireland, politicians, lawyers, street violence, and the death of his wife</p><p></p><h2>The Harappa Files</h2><p>The Greater Harappa Rehabilitation, Reclamation and Redevelopment Committee (GHRRRC) has conducted a gigantic survey of the current ethnography and urban mythology of a country on the brink of great hormonal changes.

They&#x2019;ve run away from their families and their pasts, questing after knowledge of their most wild selves, roaming the half-empty suburbs of America, occupying the homes of the foreclosed or vacationing, never staying in one place long enough to attract attention, while shoplifting beer at the local Speedy Stop. They&#x2019;re building a new society with new laws, and no one will stand in their way.<br> &nbsp;<br> But utopias are hard work, and as&nbsp;<i>Rules for Werewolves</i>&nbsp;unfolds, these young revolutionaries discover that it&#x2019;s much easier to break laws than to enforce them.

(1)</h2><p>The new series from bestselling author, Rumiko Takahashi!<br><br>Reads R to L (Japanese Style). <br><br>As a child Sakura Mamiya mysteriously disappeared in the woods behind her grandma's home.&nbsp;She returned whole and healthy, but since then she has had the power to see ghosts. Now a teenager, she just wishes&nbsp;the ghosts would leave her alone! At school, the desk next to Sakura's has been empty since the start of the school year, then one day her always-absent classmate Rinne Rokudo shows up, and he's far more than what he seems!After&nbsp;school one day, Rinne helps Sakura deal with the ghost of a boy who has a crush on her. Rinne it seems, knows just how to handle such ghosts, and has the skills and tools to properly dispatch them to the afterife (for a small fee of&nbsp;course). Sakura starts to learn more about her mysterious classmate, and her curiosity about Rinne draws her deeper into the amazing world between life and death.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi&#39;s career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan&#39;s annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel. Takahashi won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film.&#34;<i>Rin-ne</i> is the newest manga from Takahashi, creator of <i>Ranma�</i> and <i>Inuyasha</i>, two of the most successful anime and manga series of all time. Sakura is a teenage girl who can see spirits due to a narrow escape from the wheel of death and reincarnation as a child. One day, her classroom is plagued by a ghost, and she meets Rinne, a living boy filling the role of a shinigami&#x2014;a supernatural being who guides spirits to their rest. Poor and alone on Earth, he tries to cadge meals and scam a living in between dealing with unquiet spirits. Despite potential melodramatic fodder, both characters are too practical and matter-of-fact for theatrics. Instead, <i>Rin-ne</i> tells the wry and funny adventures of two lonely kids becoming friends against a background of ghost stories that are more melancholy than frightening. <i>Rin-ne</i> is not the most profound of comics nor is it the most visually stunning, but it is a satisfying and heartfelt story, with promise of greater things to come as the tale unfolds. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Crumb Sketchbook 4: Dec. 1982-Dec. 1989</h2><p><p>The first three volumes of this series were met with fervent acclaim from our readers, most of whom have been lying in wait for an affordable trade edition since the $ 1,000 boxed sets appeared.

With focused intensity and depth of knowledge, Fowler presents a rich, colorful and amusing overview of Southern baking from historical, cultural and social perspectives. In engaging prose, Damon traces the influences of Southern mamas; African-American domestic workers and cooks; English, German and French settlers; and Native Americans in his introduction, while his chapter openers delve deeper into specifics, distinguishing between, say, soft winter wheat and red summer wheat and the different flours derived from them. Educational and enticing recipes for quick breads, cookies, cakes, pies, pastries and breads include detailed instructions and tips. The stories, appearing mostly in the recipes' head notes, range from personal to technical, detailing, for example, the origins of Mrs. Hill's Crumpets, small, airy, yeast-leavened buns derived from an 1867 cookbook; Pecan Upside-Down Cake, a cross between upside-down cakes (derived from French tarte tatin) and monkey bread (a sweet, pecan-studded biscuit); and the secret to MaMa's moist Coconut Cake (from Fowler's maternal grandmother). This cookbook is a treat, equally satisfying to cook from or to read. Photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The war to free the galaxy was only now beginning. No longer insurgents, the long-suffering members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic found a thousand worlds eager to join open battle against the demoralized remnants of Palpatine&#39;s Imperial juggernaut. The military, bureaucracy and COMPNOR elite could only watch impotently as system after system, sector after sector came under Republic control. With the loss of Vader and so many talented fleet officers, things looked understandably bleak. More than that, the legions of the Empire found themselves crippled by the loss of the Emperor himself. Without the benefit of his supreme confidence and ruthless foresight, the vast Imperial war machine was paralyzed by indecision. No single individual possessed the power and the will to step forward and unite the military. Whole squadrons and battlegroups abandoned strategic objectives to follow seemingly random dispatches from competing authorities. Vast regions of space were left defenseless as the Core systems were transformed into fortress worlds. As the war pressed on, even these worlds fell, and the remaining Imperial forces retreated to isolated backwater regions of the galaxy. It became more apparent with every passing year that Palpatine had never intended his New Order to survive him. Warriors who had once terrorized a galaxy now found themselves embattled and divided.</p><p></p><h2>The Vampire Chronicles/the Queen of the Damned/the Vampire Lestat/Interview With the Vampire</h2><p>Three volumes individually signed by the author on f.f.e.p.

And so our ultimate antihero, Louis, begins the elaborate retelling of his long, tortured life as a vampire. Winding through the ages, from New Orleans to Paris, we follow Louis and his undying mentor, Lestat, as they feed on humans, whet their carnal appetites, and uncover an underworld of vampire brethren.</p><p> Book 2, <i>The Vampire Lestat</i>, brings us up to date, with Lestat waking from his earthen slumber to join the ranks of rock superstardom before sitting down to share the tale of his own haunting initiation into the vampire world. Michael York (<i>Cabaret</i>) puts his wonderfully fluid, cosmopolitan voice to good use, adding a dash of sly humor to this fast-paced, satisfying blend of sex and blood and rock and roll.</p><p> Book 3, <i>The Queen of the Damned</i>, takes us back, all the way back to ancient Egypt, exposing the origins of the vampire way. Narrating in eerily serene and gracious tones, Kate Nelligan (<i>The Prince of Tides</i>) leads us gently down this bloody path of immortal desires.

Yet these 110-foot warships performed vital chores for the fleet everywhere there was action in World War II.

Most people know the Court only as it exists between bangs of the gavel, when the Court comes to order to hear arguments or give opinions. But the stories of the Court and the Justices that come from the &#x2018;out of order&#x2019; moments add to the richness of the Court as both a branch of our government and a human institution.&#x201d;&#x2014;Justice Sandra Day O&#x2019;Connor</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> From Justice Sandra Day O&#x2019;Connor, the first woman to sit on the United States Supreme Court, comes this fascinating book about the history and evolution of the highest court in the land.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Out of Order </i>sheds light on the centuries of change and upheaval that transformed the Supreme Court from its uncertain beginnings into the remarkable institution that thrives and endures today. From the early days of circuit-riding, when justices who also served as trial judges traveled thousands of miles per year on horseback to hear cases, to the changes in civil rights ushered in by Earl Warren and Thurgood Marshall; from foundational decisions such as <i>Marbury v. Madison </i>to modern-day cases such as <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, </i>Justice O&#x2019;Connor weaves together stories and lessons from the history of the Court, charting turning points and pivotal moments that have helped define our nation&#x2019;s progress. <br> &nbsp;<br> With unparalleled insight and her unique perspective as a history-making figure, Justice O&#x2019;Connor takes us on a personal exploration, painting vivid pictures of Justices in history, including Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., one of the greatest jurists of all time; Thurgood Marshall, whose understated and succinct style would come to transform oral argument; William O. Douglas, called &#x201c;The Lone Ranger&#x201d; because of his impassioned and frequent dissents; and John Roberts, whom Justice O&#x2019;Connor considers to be the finest practitioner of oral argument she has ever witnessed in Court. We get a rare glimpse into the Supreme Court&#x2019;s inner workings: how cases are chosen for hearing; the personal relationships that exist among the Justices; and the customs and traditions, both public and private, that bind one generation of jurists to the next&#x2014;from the seating arrangements at Court lunches to the fiercely competitive basketball games played in the Court Building&#x2019;s top-floor gymnasium, the so-called &#x201c;highest court in the land.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wise, candid, and assured, <i>Out of Order </i>is a rich offering of inspiring stories of one of our country&#x2019;s most important institutions, from one of our country&#x2019;s most respected pioneers.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Out of Order</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;[A] succinct, snappy account of how today&#x2019;s court&#x2014;so powerful, so controversial and so frequently dissected by the media&#x2014;evolved from such startlingly humble and uncertain beginnings.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A brief and accessible history of the nation&#x2019;s highest court, narrated by a true historical figure and a jurisprudential giant.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;The Boston Globe</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A vibrantly personal book [that] displays O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s uncommon common sense, her dry wit and her reverence for the nation&#x2019;s institutions.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Full of riveting anecdotes . . . a compact history . . . albeit a more lighthearted, personality-filled one than you might find in a high school classroom.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Associated Press</b></p><p><b>Sandra Day O&#x2019;Connor</b> was born in El Paso, Texas, and raised on the Lazy B Ranch. She attended Stanford University, where she took Wallace Stegner&#x2019;s writing course. She began her public service in Phoenix, and was majority leader of the Arizona Senate before becoming a judge. She is the author of <i>Lazy B,</i> a memoir about growing up in the Southwest, and <i>The Majesty of the Law,</i> a reflection on American law and life. President Reagan nominated her as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and she served from 1981 to 2006. She serves as Chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary, and is on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.Looming Large<br><br>Historic Intersections of the President<br><br>and the Supreme Court<br><br>The role of the judicial branch in our system of government differs markedly from that of the executive branch. Each shoulders substantial powers and obligations under the Constitution. Whereas the Executive enforces the law, however, the Supreme Court interprets the law and has no power to command obedience or appropriate funds to enforce its orders. Whereas the President is elected by the people and serves for limited terms, federal judges are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and serve for life. Whereas the Executive reflects the political will of the majority, the judiciary is designed to check assertions of power by the political branches. It thus comes as little surprise that throughout history, the Executive and the Supreme Court have intersected, overlapped, and even clashed.<br><br>A story is told that William Howard Taft once found himself stranded at a small country railroad station. Informed that the express train would stop only for a large group of passengers, Taft wired the conductor: &#x201c;Stop at Hicksville. Large party waiting to catch train.&#x201d; When the train stopped, Taft boarded, alone. He then turned to the confused conductor. &#x201c;You can go on ahead,&#x201d; he declared. &#x201c;I am the large party.&#x201d;<br><br>We laugh at that story because we remember that Mr. Taft, at his heaviest, tipped the scales at over three hundred pounds. But as the twenty-seventh President of the United States and the tenth Chief Justice of the United States, he also was the only person ever to have tipped the scales by holding both of those incredibly &#x201c;large&#x201d; offices&#x2014;experiencing firsthand the responsibility of heading two of the most significant institutions in the free world. His time in these two roles put him on two different sides of the same constitutional coin.<br><br>Indeed, our remarkable Constitution recognizes the individual &#x201c;largeness&#x201d; of these governmental bodies while acknowledging that their relative strengths will at times coexist, at times collide, and nearly always manage to carry out the will of the majority while safeguarding the rights of the minority. A look at the dynamic between these two institutions speaks volumes about the genius of our Constitution.<br><br>To find an example of the judiciary and the presidency surviving the collision of two larger-than-life personalities, we need not travel very far into the early days of our republic. Second cousins John Marshall and Thomas Jefferson were anything but the kissing kind. Indeed, their relationship was privately nasty and publicly only slightly better. Their exchanges&#x2014;well documented, but not well-mannered&#x2014;planted the seeds for an all-out war over the proper role of the judiciary vis-�-vis the other branches of government, and set the trajectory of constitutional law as we know it today.<br><br>Jefferson almost was not our third president, coming to the post only after the House of Representatives broke an electoral tie vote in his race with Aaron Burr. Marshall almost was not our fourth Chief Justice, receiving the nomination from John Adams only after first choice John Jay declined reappointment. But once fate brought them to their respective positions of authority in 1801, Jefferson and Marshall came to blows in ways that put even today&#x2019;s climate of political acrimony to shame.<br><br>Early in his administration, Jefferson attempted to have Marshall impeached. He accused him of &#x201c;irregular and censurable&#x201d; behavior.1 In Marshall&#x2019;s hands, Jefferson lamented, &#x201c;the law is nothing more than an ambiguous text, to be explained by his sophistry into any meaning which may subserve his personal malice.&#x201d;2 He spoke vehemently of his bitter disappointment in his own appointees to the Supreme Court, calling them &#x201c;lazy&#x201d; and weak for not standing up to the &#x201c;crafty chief judge.&#x201d;3<br><br>Marshall, in turn, labeled Jefferson &#x201c;totally unfit&#x201d; for the presidency.4<br><br>Jefferson called the Chief Justice a man &#x201c;of lax lounging manners . . . and a profound hypocrisy.&#x201d;5 Over time, these two actors played out a rather hateful drama, rooted in personal animus and fundamental disagreement as to the proper role of government and the appropriate balance between the judicial and executive branches.<br><br>History teaches us that it was Marshall&#x2019;s decision in Marbury v. Madison that permanently legitimated and strengthened the Supreme Court and that gave the Chief Justice his least obvious but perhaps greatest victory over the President. Many say that that case, which came to stand for the authority of the Court to review the acts of the political branches, might as well have been captioned Marshall v. Jefferson.<br><br>Here is what happened. In the watershed 1800 election, Marshall&#x2019;s Federalist Party lost control of the executive and the legislative branches to Jefferson&#x2019;s Republicans, and in an effort to retain some presence in government, the Federalists decided to pack the Court before they left office. President Adams appointed Marshall, then the secretary of state, as Chief Justice, and Congress passed a number of pieces of legislation to restructure the court system and provide the lame-duck Senate and outgoing President Adams with many new positions to fill. Adams filled them&#x2014;or thought he did&#x2014;through a series of midnight appointments.<br><br>But Jefferson fought back. When he took office as President, he refused to deliver the commissions of some of the Adams appointees. When William Marbury, an appointed judge who didn&#x2019;t get his commission, sought a court order compelling the administration to deliver his commission, the case made its way to the Supreme Court.<br><br>Chief Justice Marshall, to the surprise of many, denied the order that would have forced his nemesis Jefferson to issue the judicial commissions. That might have seemed like a victory for the new President.<br><br>But the &#x201c;victory&#x201d; that Marshall handed to Jefferson came with a silver lining for the Court and for himself. Marshall and the Court denied the order to grant Marbury&#x2019;s commission on the grounds that the part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 that had given the Supreme Court the power to issue such orders was contrary to the Constitution.<br><br>Writing for a unanimous Court in 1803, Marshall declared &#x201c;that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by [the Constitution]&#x201d; and, more important, that it is &#x201c;emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department&#x201d; to say what the Constitution means.6<br><br>In one fell swoop, Marshall gave up a small power that Congress had conferred upon the Court and took in exchange an even larger, overarching power&#x2014;to examine and decide the ultimate constitutionality of all acts of Congress that one challenged in Court. Despite the vehement disagreement of his cousin Thomas Jefferson, this bold assertion by John Marshall about the power of the Court has survived as the final and official answer to this day. Today, portraits of Marbury and Madison hang in the Justices&#x2019; private dining room in the Supreme Court&#x2014;an ongoing reminder of how the Court established its role as a coequal branch.<br><br>The lessons to be learned from the story of Jefferson and Marshall are many. It is the story of a government that develops and evolves, that grows and changes, over time. It is the story of large institutions competing and accommodating and evolving in ways that may both amaze and alarm us. Perhaps even more significant, it is a story that begins a distinctively human thread that is woven throughout all of the Court&#x2019;s history: The judiciary and the presidency are inhabited by real people, with real emotions, real foibles, and a very real&#x2014;if sometimes conflicting&#x2014;commitment to doing what is right.<br><br>A second historic moment of interaction between the presidency and the judiciary stars President Abraham Lincoln and Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney. It represents one of the only times a sitting president has deliberately defied a direct court order.<br><br>In the early days of the Civil War, the fragile American nation faced serious threats from within. The Southern states had broken away, and European powers were poised to intervene, to divide the young nation permanently into Union and Confederacy. The war posed another sort of danger&#x2014;a danger less obvious, perhaps, than columns of soldiers marching through the countryside but far more insidious to a nation &#x201c;conceived in Liberty.&#x201d; It was the danger that a government at war might use its extraordinary powers to stamp out political opposition. In April 1861, a trainload of Union soldiers passed through Baltimore en route to Washington, summoned to man the defensive fortifications around the capital. They were greeted by an angry mob of Southern sympathizers and had to fight their way across Baltimore to reach the station where their train to Washington was waiting. Later that night, local authorities who favored the South sabotaged the bridges and telegraph lines connecting Baltimore and Washington. Their story was that they feared the soldiers might return and seek revenge for the riot, but their actions endangered the Union by cutting off the two critical cities.<br><br>With Congress out of session, President Lincoln found himself alone in the capital with the rebel army closing in from the south and an apparent insurrection brewing to the north. Taking action as commander in chief, he directed local military leaders to secure the railroad line from Washington to Philadelphia, and allowed them to suspend &#x201c;habeas corpus&#x201d; in that pursuit. Sometimes called the &#x201c;Great Writ,&#x201d; habeas corpus is the relief that a prisoner requests from a court when they are seeking release from unlawful detention. Thus, by suspending the writ, Lincoln was effectively permitting the Union army to arrest civilians without a warrant, without probable cause, without a speedy jury trial&#x2014;indeed, without any process at all. Mr. John Merryman, a member of the Maryland legislature who had been recruiting rebel soldiers, was arrested by a Union general under this scheme, and hauled off to Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor.<br><br>In those days, Justices of the Supreme Court were still &#x201c;riding circuit&#x201d;&#x2014;literally riding their horses in circles around the country to sit as federal judges on lower courts in addition to their service on the Supreme Court. Accordingly, Merryman&#x2019;s plea for relief from detention was directed at his local circuit judge, who happened to be Chief Justice Taney. Taney was no friend of Lincoln&#x2019;s administration. Upon receiving Merryman&#x2019;s plea, he ordered Merryman&#x2019;s jailer at Fort McHenry to bring Merryman to the court, a command that is the essence of habeas corpus relief. (Habeas corpus literally translates as something like &#x201c;present the body.&#x201d;) The commander refused, sending Taney an aide instead with the message that the President had authorized the colonel to suspend the Great Writ.<br><br>Taney was livid. He wrote an incendiary decision, holding that it was for Congress, and only Congress, to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. The President&#x2019;s job was only to see that the laws be &#x201c;faithfully executed.&#x201d;7 He could not change the nation&#x2019;s laws to suit his interests, even in times of war.<br><br>Lincoln gave Taney no response until Congress reconvened a month later, on July 4. At that point, he let loose his own barrage of heated rhetoric, some of which still echoes to this day. Lincoln noted that the Confederacy had renounced the Constitution under which Taney had purported to invalidate the President&#x2019;s actions and argued that, had he not acted when he did, Washington would have fallen into Southern hands and there would have been no Congress to respond to the rebellion. He famously asked: &#x201c;Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?&#x201d;8<br><br>In any event, Congress retroactively approved Lincoln&#x2019;s decision to suspend the writ and Merryman was never released. Scholars remain divided on the question whether Lincoln had the power to act as he did under the Constitution&#x2019;s &#x201c;Suspension Clause,&#x201d; which says only that habeas corpus shall not be suspended &#x201c;except when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.&#x201d; Because it appears in the part of the Constitution that deals with Congress&#x2019;s powers, some say suspension is for Congress alone. On the other hand, because it appears to permit suspension &#x201c;in cases of rebellion&#x201d; and it is the President who never takes a recess and must always safeguard the nation as commander in chief, others say that Lincoln did only what the Constitution permits. This is not the place for me to offer my own views in that debate. Suffice it to say that Lincoln won the debate in his own day, especially because Congress itself eventually sided with him in March 1863. And to his immense credit, Lincoln did not use this express authorization from Congress to trample on the civil liberties that the writ of habeas corpus was meant to protect.<br><br>Recent historical studies have made clear that Lincoln never tried to suppress political dissent, and always understood that a democracy grows stronger by allowing the people to voice their opposition to government, even in the midst of war. He appreciated that the strength of the Union lay not only in force of arms but in the liberties that were guaranteed by the open, and sometimes heated, exchange of ideas. And he no doubt would have been pleased to know that, soon after his assassination and the conclusion of the war, his predictions that habeas corpus would quickly be reinstated came to pass. In his words, &#x201c;what constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence&#x201d; is &#x201c;not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, the guns of our war steamers, or the strength of our gallant and disciplined army,&#x201d; but rather &#x201c;the love of liberty&#x201d; and &#x201c;the preservation of the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of men, in all lands, everywhere.&#x201d;9<br><br>In this way, what might otherwise be remembered as a clash between these two &#x201c;large&#x201d; historic figures can be seen as a moment of large respect for the rule of law by both the President and the Chief Justice. The constitutional debate sparked by Lincoln and Taney rages on even now. But we would do well to look beyond the conflict and to appreciate the character of the men behind the story. Their sincere, even if conflicting, examples of dedication to principle&#x2014;and to the people of a struggling nation&#x2014;loom large to this day.<br><br>A third, well-known account of the intersection between the large scopes of influence of the judiciary and the presidency is found in the story of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x2019;s Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937. Roosevelt&#x2019;s bill, more commonly known as the &#x201c;court-packing plan,&#x201d; would have increased the number of Supreme Court Justices from nine to fifteen. Indeed, the current head count of nine is engraved neither in stone nor in the Constitution, and could very well have turned out differently had Roosevelt had his way.<br><br>President Roosevelt cited the heavy workload and advancing age of many of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s then-sitting Justices to justify his proposed increase in ranks. However, historians have long focused on what is widely believed to be the real reason for his plan: According to accepted wisdom, Roosevelt was more than a little annoyed at the current Justices. The Court had been giving a thumbs-down to so much of his &#x201c;New Deal&#x201d; legislation&#x2014;various economic programs targeted at redressing the aftermath of the Great Depression.</p><h2>White Shark</h2><p><br>At a small marine institute off the coast of Connecticut, only marine biologist Simon Chase realizes that a sixteen-foot pregnant Great White is feeding in the area. But even Simon doesn't know that a far deadlier creature is about to come out of the deep and threaten everything he cares for. A creature whose malevolence is unthinkable. Whose need to feed is insatiable.

It was programmed to roam the oceans to kill and spread fear. However, it lay dormant for fifty years, trapped within a sunken German U-boat at the close of WWII, until raised by unsuspecting oceanographers in the late '90's. In the tradition of Jaws, narrator Collins portrays the "monster" with menace and a maniacal lack of conscience. This suspenseful, fast-paced chiller is depicted with danger, horror and bravado, from Mengele-style ex-periments to innocent victims and lots of action.

Heinlein</h2><p>Robert A. Heinlein began publishing in the 1940s at the dawn of the Golden Age of science fiction, and today he is considered one of the genre's 'big three' alongside Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov. His short stories were instrumental in developing its structure and rhetoric, while novels such as <i>Stranger in a Strange Land </i>and <i>Starship Troopers </i>demonstrated that such writing could be a vehicle for political argument. Heinlein&#x2019;s influence remains strong, but his legacy is fiercely contested. His vision of the future was sometimes radical, sometimes deeply conservative, and arguments have flared up recently about which faction has the most significant claim on his ideas. In this major critical study, Hugo Award-winner Farah Mendlesohn carries out a close reading of Heinlein&#x2019;s work, including unpublished stories, essays, and speeches. It sets out not to interpret a single book, but to think through the arguments Heinlein made over a lifetime about the nature of science fiction, about American politics, and about himself.</p><p></p><h2>Every Tool&#39;s A Hammer: Life Is What You Make It</h2><p><b>'Adam has drawn for us an imperative how-to for creativity...&nbsp;I am aware of no human outside of fiction more qualified to pen this rousing paean to making.

I sent them my r�sum� and an eight-by-ten picture. I wanted it to look punk, so I started coloring the picture with crayons. Danny came by and said, &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I told him and he said, &#x201c;Nina, there are such things as color Xeroxes.&#x201d;<br> <br>They came out to L.A. and held auditions. I went down in my little MG, dressed all in black. I was dying in the heat, but I had to look cool. A few weeks later, they came out again. This time they wanted me to interview a &#x201c;celebrity.&#x201d; It was Robert Morton, who went on to be Morty, the producer of David Letterman&#x2019;s show&#x2014;he was pretending to be a smart-alecky Billy Joel. It went well, but I didn&#x2019;t hear from them for a while, and I thought that was weird. I&#x2019;m not the cockiest person in the world, but I kept thinking, &#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t hire me, who are they looking for? In the whole United States, how many people are working on this sort of thing already?&#x201d; And I had rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll in my heart.<br> <br>So I called them up, and the phone number went to a hotel, I think the New York Sheraton. I hung up and told Danny, &#x201c;Oh my God, they&#x2019;re a fly-by-night organization using Warner&#x2019;s name. How are they getting away with it?&#x201d;<br> <br>He said, &#x201c;You should call back.&#x201d;<br> <br>It turned out they were the real thing&#x2014;they were working out of a hotel room&#x2014;and they wanted me to come to New York for the final verdict. I went out, and they said, &#x201c;We want you, but you have to move to New York.&#x201d; Because the company&#x2019;s name included &#x201c;satellite communications,&#x201d; I had assumed the job was going to be in L.A.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t decide, so executive producers Sue Steinberg and Robert Morton said they would show me the highlights of New York, hoping I would want to move and take the job. They took me to the public library&#x2014;hey, I like books. And we went to lunch at the Tavern on the Green. I was nervous, and when they brought out the crusty rolls, I inhaled one. It lodged in my throat&#x2014;I was choking to death. Luckily, Morty knew the Heimlich maneuver. He jumped up and saved my life. After everybody calmed down, he said, &#x201c;You owe me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re right. I&#x2019;ll take the job.&#x201d;<br> Mark:<p></p> <br>I got a call from a friend of mine in Philadelphia. We both knew a guy named Richard Bencivengo, and he said, &#x201c;I heard that Bencivengo&#x2019;s working on some sort of music video channel.&#x201d; I was unhappy at WPLJ, so I called them up. It turned out they were seeing everybody in the world. A bunch of people from PLJ went in&#x2014;I saw them at the auditions. The first audition was in a forty-eight-degree studio. It was pitch-black, with a stool and a spotlight. Freezing cold, with a spotlight in the face, the vibe was interrogation: Answer our questions or we&#x2019;re going to pluck out your eyeballs. I talked into the camera about Eric Clapton going on tour. There was a one-way window in the studio; it felt like a sci-fi movie where they do an experiment and the alien overlords watch through the window, waiting to see if your head explodes.<br> <br>It was a few weeks before I heard anything&#x2014;I guess they were scouting for talent in other cities. I had a second audition, at a different, warmer studio. They had two areas set up. One had a big white card with pictures of the Eagles taped on it, perched on an easel. They wanted me to back-announce an Eagles video, and then walk from the board to this other area, which had a ratty couch and a chair, sit down there, and throw to the next video. They were literally seeing if I could walk and talk at the same time.<br> <br>There were a couple of camera guys, and a bunch of producers, and cue cards. I had never worked with cue cards before, but I knew what I was supposed to be saying. At one point, I was so far off the cards, the producer had no idea what to hold up next. I just said, &#x201c;Next card, please.&#x201d; I found out later that went a long way toward getting me the job&#x2014;when I needed some information, I didn&#x2019;t stumble through it like a standard TV host. I spoke to the people off-camera and asked for it.<br> <br>The next section was interviewing &#x201c;Billy Joel,&#x201d; as played by Robert Morton. Billy Joel is the nicest guy ever, but Robert was being cantankerous, giving yes and no answers to questions. At the end, I talked to Sue Steinberg. I&#x2019;m six foot one, and Sue is approximately four foot nine. She looked up at me and said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll be hearing from us.&#x201d; There was something in her face that said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you this, but you so have this job.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina was the first one they hired, and then maybe a day later, J. J. I got the call very soon after that. I had a three-year contract with ABC, which owned WPLJ, but I really wanted to do MTV. I booked a vacation, went away for ten days, and let my lawyers hash it out.<br> Nina:<p></p> <br>They wanted me right away&#x2014;this was the middle of June. I asked if I could stay in L.A. for the Fourth of July. At the time, there were wonderful fireworks up and down the coast, and I really wanted to see them. I watched them from my favorite spot, Topanga Beach, and left for New York City on July 5.<br> <br>MTV was a gamble. Vicki Light, who was my agent, and Danny, who was my manager, figured it was some little cable show, and if I didn&#x2019;t like it, I could come back in three months. We weren&#x2019;t even sure it&#x2019;d still be on the air six months later.<br> <br>MTV put me up in a beautiful hotel, the Berkshire. After the incident at the Tavern on the Green, I was really scared about choking when I was by myself. For about two months, I would order room service and eat right next to the phone so I could call the front desk in case anything happened.<br> <br>The first weekend I lived in New York, I had maybe one friend outside of the people at MTV&#x2014;and I didn&#x2019;t really know them either. Mark kindly said, &#x201c;You want to go to Central Park?&#x201d; I got into a cab to meet him and immediately got into a car accident. Not a big one, but there was lots of screaming and yelling. After I finally made it to Central Park, Mark and I were walking around when a bush came alive.<br> Mark:<p></p> <br>There was some commotion in the bush, and I said, &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s probably rats fighting. No big deal. There must be some garbage there.&#x201d; Nina completely freaked out. She was so not a New York person. I thought Nina was really hot, and I was definitely attracted to her, but I was in love with Carol, so I didn&#x2019;t try to instigate anything between us&#x2014;and today, we&#x2019;re like brother and sister.<br> <br>After a format change at KWST&#x2014;it went from classic rock to top 40&#x2014;J. J. was without a job. At his MTV audition, he also interviewed &#x201c;Billy Joel&#x201d;&#x2014;and did well, despite not caring for the actual Billy Joel. When the producers told him that the job meant moving to New York City, he said, &#x201c;You see that beautiful black Jensen Interceptor sitting out there? You see those mountains, that blue sky, those big, puffy clouds? All that goes away if I go to Manhattan. But I&#x2019;ll go, &#x2019;cause I need the gig.&#x201d;<br> Nina:<p></p> <br>I met J. J. in the lobby of the Berkshire, where MTV had put us both up. He commanded your respect immediately, but he was a very sweet man. We were both Angelenos, so we talked about the sports cars that we had left behind. I had an MG; he had a Jensen Interceptor, which was a hand-built British car. He always pronounced it &#x201c;Intacepta.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t so much of a Boston accent as it was a J. J. accent. MTV gave the two of us tickets to see Judas Priest. Our seats were right in front of the speakers, so we lasted maybe thirty seconds and then went out to dinner.<br> <br>MTV had hired one other VJ, Meg Griffin. I knew she was an FM jock, and I thought she was really cool. I didn&#x2019;t get a chance to talk to her very much, because she quit almost immediately.<br> Mark:<p></p> <br>Meg had been at WNEW-FM for years, and was next in a long line of jocks who were being groomed for a full-time spot. She was great&#x2014;I was happy she got the MTV job. Meg was a very cute all-American girl next door, bangs and freckles, a Martha Quinn type. One day, before we launched, Meg did an interview with the Equators. At the end, Meg was supposed to get up: They would play some Equators music and she would dance with the band. For some reason, they had to do a few takes, and she was really uncomfortable with the whole thing. In her mind, that sealed the deal. We shared a cab uptown together after we were done for the day, and she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to quit.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told her, &#x201c;Meg, don&#x2019;t do this. You will regret this. Do not leave&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll work this out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Later, she told me there were other factors: Bob Pittman, who ran MTV, didn&#x2019;t want her to keep a part-time job at WNEW. He said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to work harder if this is your only job.&#x201d; He wanted her to have the fear that comes with no backup plan. That was Pittman&#x2014;he always wanted to keep his foot on our necks.<br> <br>Meg was at MTV for the same reason I was&#x2014;she was passionate about music. It became clear to her that wasn&#x2019;t why they hired her: Do they want me here because I love music, or because I look like whole wheat? So she quit, and got that full-time position at WNEW. That was what made room for Martha.<br> Martha:<p></p> <br>Even though I&#x2019;d graduated from NYU, I kept my desk clerk gig at Weinstein. (Some clerks stayed there for years&#x2014;the most famous being Ric Menello, who wound up directing videos for the Beastie Boys.) One afternoon in July, I was sitting on the city bus, heading back uptown to my weird apartment. Around Rockefeller Center, the traffic got really bad. The bus wasn&#x2019;t moving, so I jumped off to visit my friends at WNBC. Purely by chance, a guy named Burt Stein was also visiting. He used to work for A&amp;M Records in California, and he was hanging out at WNBC that day for no particular reason. A bunch of us were shooting the breeze in the music office. Then Burt randomly asked, &#x201c;Hey, what&#x2019;s Bob Pittman doing?&#x201d; Bob had been the youngest-ever program director of WNBC&#x2014;he left before I got there, but he was a legend.<br> <br>Buzz Brindle, assistant program director at WNBC, and a former professor of mine, said, &#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s doing this MTV thing.&#x201d; And then Buzz looked at me and uttered the words that changed my life forever: &#x201c;Martha, that&#x2019;s what you should do. You should be a VJ on MTV.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a VJ?&#x201d; I practically scoffed.<br> <br>Buzz said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a DJ on the radio, but on television.&#x201d;<br> <br>This sounded like WKRP in Cincinnati to me, so I asked the logical question, &#x201c;What do I during the records?&#x201d; I was thinking they&#x2019;d film a DJ studio.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s videos,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re playing these clips.&#x201d;<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;Oh, I can&#x2019;t do that. You know who should do that? Evan Davies, he&#x2019;s really good at music.&#x201d; Evan was another radio major from NYU.<br> <br>Buzz said, &#x201c;No, I really think you should do it.&#x201d; He picked up the phone and called Bob Pittman. It turned out it was the last day of auditions. Buzz said, &#x201c;You gotta get down there&#x2014;they&#x2019;re closing up shop at five-thirty.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was already 5 P.M., and I didn&#x2019;t know how I would get to Thirty-third Street and Tenth Avenue in time. I knew I&#x2019;d never get a cab, so I called my friend Adam, the only person I knew who had a car. Adam picked me up, dropped me off on Thirty-third Street, and went to get a pizza. I walked into the studio and said, &#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m here to audition.&#x201d; And they were like, &#x201c;Uh, who are you?&#x201d;<br> Nina:<p></p> <br>As I was running out the door, in came this young woman, barely five feet tall. As I remember it, she had a flower hat, and a T-shirt that said I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC. I thought, &#x201c;Hmmm, not very rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll.&#x201d; Not being judgmental&#x2014;I just didn&#x2019;t think she was what they were looking for.<br> Martha:<p></p> <br>I was in the outfit that I&#x2019;d put on that day to go work at Weinstein&#x2014;I was dressed for sorting mail and handing out toilet paper. I had a T-shirt with an iron-on glitter transfer that said, of all things, COUNTRY MUSIC IS IN MY BLOOD. My junior-year roommate (not the Wilhelmina model&#x2014;this one left school when she got pregnant and married a Bible salesman) gave it to me. And I was in a white tennis skirt and Keds. Not one speck of makeup. I didn&#x2019;t even have a brush for my hair.<br> <br>After they figured out that I was supposed to audition, they sat me in a barber chair in front of a camera. I read the teleprompter for a bit, and then they said, &#x201c;Okay, now tell us about a concert that you&#x2019;ve been to.&#x201d; I talked about an Earth, Wind &amp; Fire show at Madison Square Garden. I had no idea what was at stake&#x2014;if I did, I probably would have been too jittery to get the job! The audition was literally three minutes, but by the time it was over, I had a pretty good idea of what this MTV thing was about and I really wanted the gig. I called my brother and said, &#x201c;I auditioned for something that is perfect for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>A couple of days later, after getting my hair cut at the Plaza&#x2014;courtesy of Jane Bryant Quinn&#x2014;I checked my messages from the corner of Sixth Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street. That was back when you had to access your answering machine with a little beeper. There was a message: Sue Steinberg saying, &#x201c;Come to the studio, we think we have good news.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hailed a cab right away. When I got to the studio, I was escorted upstairs to a conference room with executive producers Sue Steinberg and Julian Goldberg. They asked, &#x201c;So how would you like to have a job where you fly around the country and interview rock stars and go to concerts and be on TV?&#x201d;<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t even ask, &#x201c;How much?&#x201d; I was twenty-two years old.<br> Mark:<p></p> <br>We were doing run-throughs, practicing as we led up to the channel&#x2019;s debut on August 1. Martha and Alan joined very late, in mid-July. I watched Martha and thought, &#x201c;Who is this kid? She has no idea what she&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d; Neither did I, but I did know music. It was clear to me that they were desperate as we got closer to the launch: They wanted five VJs, and they didn&#x2019;t have them.<br> Alan:<p></p> <br>In the summer of 1981, I went to a &#x201c;Way Up North in Mississippi&#x201d; picnic in Central Park, an event for anybody born, bred, or educated in the state of Mississippi. There were hundreds of people at the picnic, eating watermelon, spitting seeds, doing the barbecue thing. They even&#x2014;oh, Lord&#x2014;sang &#x201c;Dixie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bob Pittman showed up in a jacket, snazzily dressed for a hot summer day in New York City. I was wearing some grungy shorts. Bob&#x2019;s father was friends with my father-in-law; they were both Methodist ministers. So I was introduced to Bob; I didn&#x2019;t know a damn thing about him except he was big in radio. I told him I was a struggling actor, bartending at night, going to auditions, trying to catch a ride somewhere. He told me he was working on a new cable channel for Warner AmEx: music video, twenty-four hours a day. &#x201c;Really? I was just in this David Bowie video.&#x201d; I told him about &#x201c;Fashion.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how spinning videos twenty-four hours a day would work, but I was polite about it. Bob was a nice guy, but aloof. A very cool cucumber.<br> <br>Two weeks later, I got a phone call from Sue Steinberg. I don&#x2019;t know how she got my phone number, but she said, &#x201c;Bob bumped into you at the park and thinks you should audition for this thing we got going, called The Music Channel.&#x201d;<br> <br>I went to the audition totally blind. I had to read some teleprompter copy, no problem. I was a good cold read...</p><h2>To Love and to Cherish (Cactus Creek Cowboys, 2)</h2><p><p><b>From <em>USA Today</em> Bestselling Author Leigh Greenwood comes a historical Western romance filled with gritty cowboys, strong-willed women, and a whole lot of heart in the Wild West </b></p><p><strong>Laurie Spencer</strong> should not feel relieved after burying her husband, but she does.

Her husband's death had been sudden and unexpected-a shock to the whole town. The doctor said his heart just gave out, most likely brought on by stress. To everyone else, Noah had seemed like a calm, quiet, sensible man who led a calm, quiet, sensible life married to a calm, quiet, sensible wife. Not even his brother knew that Noah lived on the edge of a precipice, petrified that any moment he would be catapulted into the abyss beyond.</p> <p>Only Laurie knew that she was the abyss.</p> <p>Laurie was surrounded by her parents, her cousins and brother-in-law, and by neighbors she had known all her life, but she had never felt more alone. The ice-cold wind blowing in from the desert failed to drive away the lead-hued clouds that hung low on the horizon. Not since the day she arrived had this land of pines and sagebrush felt so little like home, so much like an alien world into which she'd been pitched against her will.</p> <p>On either side, her cousins Naomi and Sibyl gripped her hands tightly in theirs. Both knew Laurie had been forced to marry a man she didn't love, but neither knew how many times she'd prayed for his death. It had seemed the only means of escape from a life that was an impregnable prison despite the absence of walls. Guilt battled with relief. It was joined by fear of the future and a nearly mad need to escape the past. The conflict left Laurie weary, unsure of what to do, where to go, who to trust. For the first time since the day of her birth, her life was her own. The prospect thrilled and frightened her.</p> <p>It had come too fast. She wasn't expecting it. Despite years of aimless daydreams about possible escape, she had no plan for what to do if it should happen, no goal beyond freedom from a marriage that was slowly smothering her. Even now, she found herself breathing deeply, drinking in the dry air in great gulps and feeling the bonds loosening and falling away. Her chest expanded as the air sank deeper into her lungs, sending oxygen to clear the mists from her brain, energy to the muscles that had dragged her body through each day with wearying effort.</p> <p>Everything before her stood out in sharper detail, the colors more luminous, the textures more luxurious. She might as well have spent the four years of her marriage in hibernation. She had gone to sleep at seventeen and had awakened at twenty-one to find she didn't know who she was or who she wanted to become. Those years had left almost no trace-just a mist through which she'd wandered without a goal beyond escape.</p> <p>"Noah would choose the coldest time of the year to die," Norman Spencer grumbled.</p> <p>"I don't understand why he died at all," Laurie's father said for what had to be the twentieth time in the last two days.</p> <p>"Doctor Kessling said his heart just gave out. It was most likely brought on by stress," Laurie told him. "I don't see why you can't accept that."</p> <p>"But he was so young."</p> <p>"Lots of people die young," Norman said, "but I never thought it would happen to Noah."</p> <p>Norman believed he and his brother had been born of a superior race, one that was immune to the mental and physical shortcomings that prevented other people from achieving their same level of success.</p> <p>"They can finish filling in the grave without us standing here freezing," Naomi Blaine said to her cousin. "Everything at Sibyl's house will be ready by now."</p> <p>Laurie allowed Naomi to escort her from the cemetery despite Norman declaring that it was disrespectful for a wife to leave until the last bit of dirt had been piled on the grave. That didn't stop him from leaving, too. The wake was being held at his home. He wouldn't have considered allowing it to begin without his presence.</p> <p>"I know you've been too grief-stricken to think about looking into the settlements Noah made in his will," Norman said to Laurie as he walked alongside her. "If you feel up to it, come by the bank in the morning and I'll go over everything with you."</p> <p>"What's there to go over?" Naomi asked. "Laurie was Noah's wife, and they had no children."</p> <p>"There is business to be discussed. I wouldn't expect you to understand."</p> <p>Norman refused to believe a woman could do anything beyond keep house and take care of children.</p> <p>"I'll be there." Laurie was eager to have the will read and Noah's estate settled. For the first time, she'd have money of her own and the freedom to decide what to do with the rest of her life. She was certain of only one thing-she would never marry again. Nothing could induce her to put herself under the control of any man.</p> <p>The walk to Norman's house was short. Cactus Corner was a small place in the Verde River Valley that had been formed three years earlier when twelve families from Kentucky chose it as the site of their new town. In that short time, homes had been built, businesses had opened, and new families had come to settle either in town or in the valley. As her cousin's husband, Colby, said, the Arizona Territory was an empty place just waiting for people to fill it up. Noah had been excited about the arrival of new settlers. That meant more customers, more business, and more money. Laurie had been pleased because keeping Noah busy meant less time with him watching her like she was a small animal and he a hawk about to pounce.</p> <p>She was relieved to arrive at Norman and Sibyl Spencer's house because Norman was forced to pay attention to his guests rather than her.</p> <p>"How are you holding up?" Sibyl whispered as soon as she could pull Laurie aside. "Are you sure you're up to meeting all these people?"</p> <p>"I see them every day," Laurie said. "They didn't like Noah any more than I did. Why should it be hard to see them?"</p> <p>Sibyl looked uncomfortable with Laurie's forthrightness. Naomi laughed, but that's what Laurie expected her to do. Naomi was married to a man who loved her deeply and believed there was nothing she couldn't do. Naomi had shocked many people when she'd insisted that they shouldn't start building houses just anywhere-they had to organize a real town with a street for business and areas for private homes.</p> <p>Despite opposition from Norman, she took on the job of laying out the town and selling lots to the newcomers. Most men still had trouble getting used to talking to a woman about business, but Naomi's success had given Laurie hope that she might someday be equally independent. After four years of virtual imprisonment in a marriage that had been forced upon her, nothing but complete freedom would do.</p> <p>Accepting condolences from people she'd known all her life and mouthing meaningless responses didn't take much thought, but Laurie was relieved when everyone had spoken to her and transferred their attention to the food and each other. Norman was presiding over the gathering, which allowed Sibyl and Naomi to stay at Laurie's side. No one would be surprised that Laurie's parents weren't standing with her. Her break with them was known to everyone. Laurie was only comfortable when she was with her two cousins, but there was little more that could be said today. So it was no surprise that, standing in silence with nothing more to do than watch people eat Norman's food, she was instantly aware of a stranger the moment he entered the house. He didn't look all that different on the outside, but she knew instantly he was unlike any man she'd ever seen before.</p> <p>He was tall and so broad-shouldered he filled the doorway. He was handsome and eagle-eyed, with a presence so arresting that it penetrated even Norman's sense of superiority. But that wasn't what riveted Laurie's attention and caused her stomach to tighten. There was a sensuality about him that reached out to her from across the room. It couldn't have been any more powerful if he'd touched her. When his gaze found hers, she felt that he had.</p> <p>"Who is that man?" she asked Sibyl.</p> <p>It was Naomi who answered. "Don't you remember? His name is Jared Smith. He was with the traders we followed into Santa Fe after Colby left us. He bought a ranch about five miles up the river."</p> <p>"I've never seen his wife in the store." Laurie had worked there every day of her marriage. Noah had said he didn't want to waste money hiring an extra clerk, but Laurie knew he required her to work alongside him because he was petrified she would run away if he let her out of his sight.</p> <p>"He's not married. He just got out of the army. He worked at the fort."</p> <p>"How do you know so much about him?"</p> <p>"I met him when he was in town setting up an account at the bank. I tried to convince him to buy a lot in town, but he said he intended to live on his ranch."</p> <p>"Norman hasn't said anything about him," Sibyl said, "so he can't be too prosperous. Norman can smell money faster than a coyote can smell a mouse."</p> <p>Norman was tight-fisted when it came to money, but he'd been openhanded in providing loans to people to build homes and start businesses. His uncharacteristic generosity and the source of the money was still a topic of whispered conversations.</p> <p>Laurie thought Jared Smith looked quite prosperous, but she was probably confusing financial prosperity with his physical prowess. The man was a testament to Mother Nature's ability to produce an exceptional being when she wanted. If he'd been a wild stallion, Laurie could visualize him sniffing the air and tossing his head in impatience, daring anyone to challenge his superiority. When he started toward Laurie, her whole body quivered.</p> <p>The crowd that filled Norman's parlor seemed to make way for this man, enabling him to approach Laurie on a path as arrow-straight as his gaze. When he came to a stop before her, she felt dwarfed by his size as well as the energy that radiated from him.</p> <p>"My condolences, ma'am," he said in a voice that was as deep as he was tall. "I didn't know your husband, but he must have been a fine man to have the whole community turn out for his wake."</p> <p>How could a man who could make his presence be felt from across the room act so ordinary? She struggled to find words to respond, but none came.</p> <p>"We're a small community," Naomi answered for her. "Many of us are related. We've known Noah all our lives."</p> <p>"That makes the loss all the greater. As you know, I was in the army. I'm well acquainted with death. It's never easy no matter the time or the manner." He turned back to Laurie. "I'm a stranger to everyone here, so I won't stay."</p> <p>Laurie found her tongue. "You won't find a better time to meet everyone outside of church."</p> <p>Mr. Smith smiled, and Laurie felt a response awaken inside her that she'd thought long dead. "Some other time. I don't want to take time from your family and friends."</p> <p>Sibyl tried to protest, saying everyone would be glad to meet him, but Laurie knew he wouldn't change his mind. He was a man who went his own way, chose his own goals, and required approval from no one. The odd thing was that she felt there was something familiar about him. That was ridiculous. Noah had done everything in his power to ensure that she never met a man, so she was certain she'd never seen him before today.</p> <p>"Who is that man?"</p> <p>Laurie turned to find Cassie approaching and smiled inwardly. If there was anyone who could sense the presence of a handsome man, it was Cassie Greene. The wonder was that Mr. Smith had left without being dazzled by the beautiful young widow.</p> <p>"He's a rancher," Naomi told Cassie. "He's unmarried, so he's fair game."</p> <p>Cassie laughed. "Maybe, but he's not for me. He couldn't see any woman in this room but Laurie."</p> <p>Laurie didn't think she'd ever get used to Cassie's artlessness. There wasn't a mean or jealous bone in her body, but she didn't hesitate to put into words what another woman would hesitate to think.</p> <p>"I'm sure that's only because he came to offer his condolences on Noah's death," Naomi said.</p> <p>Cassie's look of wide-eyed innocence was as alarming as it was genuine. "I may have a prettier face, but Laurie has the kind of figure that keeps men awake at night."</p> <p>Heat suffused Laurie's face. The person her figure kept awake had been Noah, but that hadn't benefited either of them.</p> <p>"You've got to stop saying things like that," Naomi scolded Cassie.</p> <p>"Why? It's true."</p> <p>"I've told you a hundred times-"</p> <p>"I know. I've got to stop uttering every thought that comes into my head. I wouldn't have said it to anyone but you." And anyone within hearing.</p> <p>As a young girl, Laurie had been proud of her figure. She had confessed to her cousins that though she was careful to offer no encouragement, she enjoyed the looks the soldiers cast in her direction. Her husband hadn't liked anything about her body, had said it was so grossly out of shape that he couldn't bring himself to make love to her. He had complained that her breasts were so big they made her look top-heavy. He said her waist was so small in comparison to her hips that she looked deformed. He accused her of intentionally putting a swing into her step to attract the notice of any man who happened to walk by. She had become so paranoid she had done everything she could to disguise the shape of her body.</p> <p>"I know this isn't a nice thing to say"-Cassie cast a defiant glance at Naomi-"but I'm glad there's another widow in town. I'm tired of being treated like a potential threat to every woman's marriage."</p> <p>"We don't feel like that," Naomi assured her.</p> <p>"You don't because Colby can't see any woman except you, but not every husband's gaze stays so close to home."</p> <p>Laurie liked Cassie. The young woman's candidness was a breath of fresh air in her stale life, but she didn't intend to become a bosom friend. Once she had access to Noah's estate, she intended to change her life completely. The fact that she didn't know what those changes were going to be didn't matter. She might even go away. She'd never been allowed to go anywhere without her parents before her marriage, or her husband afterward.</p> <p>It was hard to imagine doing anything on her own, but she was excited about the possibility and intimidated by it as well. The future was unknown, the possibilities limitless. She had never faced anything unknown or without limits. She didn't know if she could handle it. Maybe it would be better if she stayed in Cactus Corner and continued her life as it was. She would have her freedom. That's all she'd ever wanted.</p> <p>"Some of the guests are getting ready to leave," Sibyl told her. "They'll want to say good-bye."</p> <p>That seemed pointless since she'd see any number of them the moment she stepped outside, but she prepared to say all the proper things. After all, this was the last time she would have to do that. After she saw Norman tomorrow, she would be free. The thought buoyed her spirits so much that she had to caution herself to continue to appear grave. She wasn't going to pretend to be grief-stricken. Too many people knew about the condition of her marriage, but it wouldn't do to appear happy about Noah's death. Even those who knew the state of her marriage wouldn't accept that.</p> <p>"I think everyone in town showed up," Norman...</p></p><h2>The Cobra Event</h2><p>Exhilarating thriller</p><p>In New York City in the late '90s, a 17-year-old girl heads off to her private school even though she has a cold. By art class her nose is gushing mucus and she's severely disoriented. Within seconds, it seems, she's in convulsions and, most bizarrely, can't stop biting herself. All the reader can do is hope she'll die quickly, but Kate Moran's body still has a few more disgusting turns to undergo, and Richard Preston--a Jacobean master of ceremonies par excellence--takes us through them in bizarre and bloody detail. <p> Clearly, whatever Kate had was a head cold with a scientific vengeance. Preston's heroine, Alice Austen, a doctor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, realizes--in the first of several gripping autopsy scenes--that the girl's nervous system had been virtually destroyed. So far, only one other person is known to have died in the same way, but he was a homeless man. Austen must connect the two cases, seemingly linked only by the subway, before the media gets hold of them and drums up a paranoia-fest--and before the virus's creator can kill again. </p><p> <i>The Cobra Event</i> is itself a paranoia-fest, a provocative thriller that makes you wonder exactly how much bioterrorism is taking place in the real world. Preston, best known for his terrifying chronicle of the Ebola virus, <i>The Hot Zone</i>, and other impeccably researched nonfictions, is not content to create fast-paced nightmarish scenes. His novel is instead a complex morality tale anchored in uncomfortable fact. Preston is keen to convey the "invisible history" of bioweapons engineering and, equally, to show the unsung heroism of his scientific detectives (along with that of the nurses and technicians who literally sacrifice their lives for medicine). Like their creator, these characters are not without a sense of humor. One calls the manmade virus "the ultimate head cold." Readers will never forget literally dozens of scenes and will never again see the subway, rodents, autopsy knives, and--above all--runny noses in the same light.</p><b>Read what our listeners are saying . . .</b><p>Review by Mike Sussman, Marietta, GA</p><p><b>The Cobra Event</b> is the first novel by Richard Preston, author of <i>The Hot Zone</i>. An outbreak of a new deadly disease is taking place in New York City. The disease starts out like a cold, but its victims turn to self-mutilation and suffer a horrible death. Although the victims appear<br>to have nothing in common, the C.D.C sends pathologist Alice Austen to investigate, and with the assistance of a secret government medical team, she determines that the epidemic is caused by biological<br>terrorism. Now the team must find the culprit before the disease reaches national proportions.</p><p>Preston's follow-up to <i>The Hot Zone</i> is a fascinating and terrifying medical thriller. While the story is fiction, <i>The Cobra Event</i> is based on facts, and the scary aspect is that the events in the novel are quite feasible. Preston writes with an air of authenticity and presents us with extraordinary possibilities. His strength lies with science over characters, but this is overcome by a strong, intriguing story. <i>The Cobra Event</i> is a must read for all fans of medical thrillers.</p><p>The audio version is 4 tapes, abridged, published by Random House, and enthusiastically read by Blair Underwood. His performance is very entertaining, he has no difficulty with the medical terminology, and<br>Underwood's only flaw is reading too quickly when exciting scenes occur. However, this can be overlooked as his pacing helps maintain the suspense. Although the audio is abridged, many of the gruesome descriptions of the disease are included, but I couldn't help but wonder if the text was even more graphic. Still, listeners will be glued to their cassette players.</p></p><h2>Cupcake Diaries 4 Books in 1!: Katie and the Cupcake Cure; Mia in the Mix; Emma on Thin Icing; Alexis and the Perfect Recipe</h2><p>The first four Cupcake Club adventures are now available as one sweet treat of a book!<br><br>Join Katie, Mia, Emma, and Alexis as they form the Cupcake Club&#x2014;and fast friendships.

It cuts a wide path through the worst and the best of what we are."<br>BARBARA KINGSOLVER<br>From the mining shanty towns of West Virginia comes this moving and passionate saga of a family, a community, and a way of life all but gone. In this coal-smudged place, Dillon, Rachel, and Jackie hopelessly intertwined in love and politics live in the shadow of the dying mines and the doomed union movement. Set against the devastation of the Depression, the fearful pulse of a world at war, the dawning hope of the War on Poverty, and, ultimately, the untamable force of nature herself, THE UNQUIET EARTH is a bold and bittersweet story of unforgettable men and women, and the times that made them great.</p><p>I was selling these books for quite a while before I looked at them as novels I might like to read. It was another sales rep who kept after me to read 'just one'. He had told me that I would love them, and learn a lot as well. One time, when I was on the road, and suddenly, without a book to read, I actually bought one copy from a surprised bookseller, who wasn't in the habit of selling a publishers' rep a book from their own company. Anyway, I checked into my hotel, starting to read STORMING HEAVEN, and finished it all in one night. The other rep was quite right--I had never even known that there were Mine Wars in this country, let alone ones so violent that our own army would be called out to subdue the coal miners amid the hills of West Virginia. It was fascinating and heartbreaking, all at the same time. The author also takes great pains in describing the real connection these coal miners (and their families) feel to the actual earth beneath their feet. The connection is made all the more searing when some of the coalminers blood seeps into this earth in the violence of the strike. It was also the first time I had read a book about the union that crossed all ethnic and religious lines--the Irish, the Italians, the Jews, the Christians and others all united mightily together for their fight .It is incredibly powerful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I followed up with UNQUIET EARTH pretty quickly, although it did not hit me as powerfully as STORMING. This books picks up in the 30's and takes us through the doomed union efforts of fifty years before ending in the 80's with a defeated union and a truly depleted earth. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>When there is news of strikes in the air, like the UPS strike or more recently , the GM strike, my mind always, always goes back to the experience of reading STORMING HEAVEN.<br><br>-Alice Kesterson, Ballantine Regional Sales ManagerDenise Giardina is the author of Storming Heaven, Emily&#39;s Ghost, and Saints and Villains, which won the Boston Book Review Prize.

Whether honoured and admired or criticized and ridiculed, Florence Nightingale has invariably been misrepresented and misunderstood. As the Lady with the Lamp, ministering to the wounded and dying of the Crimean War, she offers an enduring image of sentimental appeal and one that is permanently lodged in our national consciousness. But the awesome scale of her achievements over the course of her 90 years is infinitely more troubling - and inspiring - than this mythical simplification. From her tireless campaigning and staggering intellectual abilities to her tortured relationship with her sister and her distressing medical condition, this vivid and immensely readable biography draws on a wealth of unpublished material and previously unseen family papers, disentangling the myth from the reality and reinvigorating with new life one of the most iconic figures in modern British history.</p><p>Mark Bostridge won the Gladstone Memorial Prize at Oxford University. His first book Vera Brittain: A Life was shortlisted for the Whitbread Biography Prize, the NCR Non-Fiction Award, and the Fawcett Prize. His books also include the bestselling Letters from a Lost Generation; Lives for Sale, a collection of biographers&#39; tales; Because You Died; and The Fateful Year. England 1914 published in 2014.

The Ridiculous Name of NightingaleTake a walk south from the Porta Romana in Florence today, along the Via Senese, then turn westwards, and you will soon find yourself climbing a steep path along a narrow winding road. High stone walls, mossy and mottled with age, obliterate the view in either direction, but tall cypress trees line the route, and olives and vines run down to the walls on both sides.Towards the summit, at a bend in the road, a large house comes into view. The Villa La Colombaia is now a convent junior school with an imposing modern stone fa�ade, but parts of the house date back to the fifteenth century. On its garden side the original low building with shuttered windows, arranged around a courtyard, is still in existence. A gravel walk through an elegantly laid-out garden leads to a magnificent view over the city, of Brunelleschi's white ribbed dome amid a sea of red rooftops.It was from this 'Maison de Campagne', on a spring day in 1820, that twenty-six-year-old William Nightingale wrote to his brother-in-law Ben Smith about the expected imminent arrival of his second child. The city of Florence itself seemed deserted -- everyone was travelling to Rome for Holy Week -- but William and his heavily pregnant wife Fanny were taking advantage of the fine weather to ride up and down the hillside, he on a pony, she in a carriage driven by grey horses.As William wrote his letter, his first child, Parthenope, born just a year before in Naples, was wriggling about on his knee, proving 'so rumbustical I can hardly scribble'. He was confident that the new baby would be a boy, though apologetic that he could not report 'by the same post the arrival of a young Ulysses, the protector of Parthenope ... He is expected every minute not to say moment, but delays his arrival I know not why ...'It would be a further five weeks before William Nightingale was able to announce the birth of another daughter.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>'I found a house at Florence on the hill/of Bellosguardo,' wrote Elizabeth Barrett Browning in <i>Aurora Leigh</i>. Walk on a short distance from the Villa La Colombaia, and the legendary beauty of this small area outside the city gates, which has attracted so many well-to-do and famous visitors through the centuries, is immediately apparent. A stone monument at the roadside records some of the distinguished names who have lived or stayed at Bellosguardo: among them, Galileo, who retreated here after his appearance before the Inquisition, James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, the Brownings, Henry James, Clara Schumann and, the penultimate name on the list, above that of Violet Trefusis, Florence Nightingale.It is Henry James who provides the location of Florence Nightingale's birthplace with the link to a neat little biographical irony. For it was while staying, in 1887, at the Casa Brichieri-Colombi, another of the grand villas on the road leading to the brow of Bellosguardo, that James wrote the first draft of <i>The Aspern Papers.</i> James's novella, with its story of a would-be biographer who attempts to prise some letters of a famous American poet, Jeffrey Aspern, from an old woman, only to discover that she has burned them one by one, has been described as a moral fable for historians and biographers. It dramatizes the biographer's primordial fear: the destruction of the manuscript evidence, so vital to the craft, literally obliterated in a cloud of smoke.The contrast with the fate of Florence Nightingale's manuscripts could scarcely be greater. While not a scrap of the Aspern papers is left for posterity, Nightingale's biographer has to struggle hard not to be buried under a veritable mountain of material, to the extent that he may find himself occasionally wishing that the odd bonfire had actually taken place. Florence Nightingale was an inveterate hoarder. She preserved not only letters, diaries, personal notes and jottings, but also copies and drafts of letters -- and corrections of drafts. Identical, or almost identical, phrases in her letters sometimes make her seem like an actress rehearsing lines for a favourite role. At her death, paper was scattered through practically every corner of the first floor of her house at 10 South Street, even 'inside piano stools, behind coal scuttles, under sofas'. She had enough letters in her drawers, she had written in 1895, 'to cover Australia'.Today, the collection at the British Library, the second largest among personal archives after that of Gladstone, fills almost 200 bound volumes,and this represents merely the tip of the iceberg. At Claydon House in Buckinghamshire, the home for thirty years of Nightingale's sister Parthenope, Lady Verney, there is another massive collection, which includes Florence Nightingale's letters to her parents and sister, and correspondence between members of the extended Nightingale family network, over a period of more than a century. The London Metropolitan Archives are a third major Nightingale repository connected with the running of the nursing training school founded in Florence Nightingale's name at St Thomas's Hospital, in 1860. In addition to these, there are some 200 smaller holdings of Nightingale papers around the world. Although there are significant gaps in the records -- some sanctioned by Nightingale's family and executors, who destroyed certain letters after the appearance of the two authorized biographies by Sir Edward Cook and Ida O'Malley -- Florence Nightingale's life is one of the best documented of the Victorian age, certainly the best documented of any Victorian woman. And previously unknown letters continue to materialize, most dramatically during the Second World War, when it was only quick thinking on the part of some individual that prevented Nightingale's forty-seven surviving letters to one of her Crimean War colleagues, Reverend Mother Mary Clare Moore, from being burned during the attack by a V-2 rocket which destroyed the Convent of Mercy in Bermondsey.It might, though, have all turned out rather differently. As a young woman, in her first professional appointment, in 1853, as Superintendent of the Upper Harley Street Establishment for Gentlewomen during Illness, Florence Nightingale had conceived of a time when she might start keeping her letters, '&amp; after my death gratify the public with them'. Post-Crimea, however, and fame and influence made her more wary of the likely incursions of posterity, causing her to make radically different plans. 'Destroy', 'Return', 'Burn' are words which appear regularly from this time, scrawled across the upper left-hand corner of her letters. In 1860 she begged Henry (later Cardinal) Manning to burn her letters to him, adding that 'I have alas! met with such treachery in my poor life that any carelessness on the part of those I know to be friendly to me might easily be turned to bad account'; and four years later she recorded in a private note that she had 'taken effectual means' that 'all my papers' would be destroyed after her death. A clause in Nightingale's will of 1896 confirmed this arrangement. She 'earnestly entreated' her friendsand executors that all her letters, papers and manuscripts, with the exception of those relating to her work for India, be destroyed 'without examination'. Five years later she changed her mind. She still believed that the majority of her papers should be destroyed, but she was bequeathing them to her cousin Henry Bonham Carter, leaving him with the difficult decision of what to preserve. Evidently he couldn't bring himself to effect their mass destruction either.Why did Nightingale change her mind? She was certainly not oblivious to the threat posed by biography. 'I earnestly wish that no ... biography of me should be given by my family or friends,' she insisted in 1862 when the onset of severe spinal pain made her 'impatient for death'. Thirty years later, she joked, 'Well might Sir Cornwall Lewis say: "A new terror is added to death",' after learning that her letters to Sidney Herbert had been lent to his biographer, Lord Stanmore, without her consent. Yet she allowed plenty of material that was damaging to her own reputation to survive.1In the end its survival may simply be attributed to the fact that, towards the end of her life, Nightingale lacked the time and energy to embark on such a massive process of sorting and disposal. Alternatively, it could be seen as an expression of a lifelong inner conflict between a natural desire for recognition, and a deep religious conviction that she must walk invisible and avoid the snares and delusions of self-love. Or it may be that writing itself was so much a part of her identity that ultimately she could not bear to see her literary remains consigned to the flames.For writing was Florence Nightingale's lifeblood. This was a woman, after all, who even while in the depths of delirium in the Crimea, in May 1855, insisted on being brought pen and paper, and only with these in her possession did ...</p><h2>Firebirds Rising: An Anthology of Original Science Fiction and Fantasy</h2><p>Here is the eagerly anticipated follow-up to the award-winning anthology Firebirds!

Thompson, Leary, and Robins</p><p>Clinical psychologist Whitmer invites readers on a trip down memory lane via interviews with '60s-era mavericks. Psychologist Timothy Leary, whose LSD experiments at Harvard spilled over from the lab into his private life, poet Allen Ginsberg, and writers William Burroughs, Ken Kesey, Norman Mailer, Tom Robbins and Hunter S. Thompson reveal the serendipitous nature of their encounters with one another, their clashes with the law and the establishment, bouts of drug abuse, and the relationship between the psychedelic experience and their creativity. Depicted is a 1982 poetry reading by Ginsberg, the audience divided between long-haired '60s devotees and '80s preppies on a class assignment that Whitmer likens to "spending a day at Peabody Museum looking at pre-Columbian basket weaving for Anthro 1-A." His self-indulgent prose, where substance is sacrificed for jazziness, fails to transmit across the generation gap the magic and urgency of the '60s revolution. Photos not seen by PW. (July <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.By combining interviews with complementary background information, Whitmer offers fascinating though uneven views of William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary, Norman Mailer, Tom Robbins, and Hunter S. Thompson. While it is impossible to fully explain "the finger-snap change of a generation of dull caterpillars into a nation of gaudy butterflies," Whitmer does help us better understand these seven interwoven lives and how they affected each other and society. The book is fleshed out with chapters on the Esalen Institute, Berkeley in the Sixties, and the recent commune experience of Rajneeshpuram. Not a scholarly work, but a compelling one.

Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work "raw," and Brian De Palma's movie was so successful that we <i>feel</i> like we have read the novel even if we never have. The simple answer is that this is a very scary story, one that works as well--if not better--on the page as on the screen. Carrie White, menaced by bullies at school and her religious nut of a mother at home, gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, powers that will eventually be turned on her tormentors. King has a way of getting under the skin of his readers by creating an utterly believable world that throbs with menace before finally exploding. He builds the tension in this early work by piecing together extracts from newspaper reports, journals, and scientific papers, as well as more traditional first- and third-person narrative in order to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of Chamberlain, Maine.<p> </p><blockquote>News item from the Westover (ME) weekly <i>Enterprise</i>, August 19, 1966: "Rain of Stones Reported: It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August 17th." </blockquote> <p> Although the supernatural pyrotechnics are handled with King's customary aplomb, it is the carefully drawn portrait of the little horrors of small towns, high schools, and adolescent sexuality that give this novel its power, and assures its place in the King canon. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>El escalofriante caso de una joven en apariencia insignificante que se transform� en un ser de poderes anormales, sembrando el terror en su ciudad. Con pulo m�gico para mantener la tensi�n a lo largo de todo el libro, Stephen King narra la atormentada adolescencia de Carrie, y nos envuelve en una atm�sfera sobrecogedora cuando la muchacha realiza una seie de descubrimientos hasta llegar al terrible momento de la vengaza. esta novela fue llevada al cina y obtuvo un imenso �xito de p�blico y de cr�tica.<p><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p></p><h2>Hollywood Worldviews: Watching Films With Wisdom &amp; Discernment</h2><p>Do you watch movies with your eyes open? <p>You buy your tickets and concessions, and you walk into the theater. Celluloid images flash at twenty-four frames per second, and the hypnotic sequence of moving pictures coaxes you to suspend disbelief and be entertained by the implausible. </p><p>Unfortunately, many often suspend their beliefs as well, succumbing to subtle lessons in how to behave, think and even perceive reality. Do you find yourself hoping that a sister will succeed in seducing her sibling's husband, that a thief will get away with his crime, that a serial killer will escape judgment? Do you, too, laugh at the bumbling priest and seethe at the intolerant and abusive evangelist? Do you embrace worldviews that infect your faith and wonder, after your head is clear, whether your faith can survive the infection? </p><p>Brian Godawa guides you through the place of redemption in film, the tricks screenwriters use to communicate their message, and the mental and spiritual discipline required for watching movies. Hollywood Worldviews helps you enter a dialogue with Hollywood that leads to a happier ending, one that keeps you aware of your culture and awake to your faith.</p></p><p>Godawa is an award-winning screenwriter. He has also taught and written on film and philosophy, screenwriting, and the art of watching movies. Four of his screenplays have won multiple awards in such competitions as the Nicholl Fellowship, Austin Heart of Film, Fade-In, Worldfest, Writer&#39;s Network, Chesterfield Writer&#39;s Film Project, Columbus Discovery Award and Reader&#39;s Digest Screenplay Competition.An award-winning Christian Hollywood scriptwriter offers this rather uneven book on how to watch movies discerningly as a faithful Christian. Godawa's purpose is not to help readers decide which films are worth seeing (for that he refers them to Christian Web sites), but rather how to "read" a film for its messages as opposed to absorbing it only as entertainment. One of his main arguments is that Christians should engage the world of popular culture in order to reform it. Unfortunately, it is not always clear who he expects his audience to be. Sometimes he writes very simplistically; he ends his definition of "worldview" with the phrase "it is our view of the world" and details elements of stories and myths that many high school graduates would be familiar with. But other sections use very academic prose about complex philosophies like existentialism and postmodernism. He reveals a clearly defined, even narrow, view of Christianity by asserting the "correct" way one should live or interpret the Bible. "Rare is the movie that paints an accurate portrait of heaven and hell," he tells us. (Just what, exactly, would an "accurate" portrayal look like?) The fact that each chapter ends with assignments and discussion questions gives it a strong pedantic twist. Despite these flaws, in the hands of the right audience conservative Christians willing to approach it as a textbook and who don't mind having a few movie plots betrayed this guide will encourage more thoughtful film consumption without killing the fun of moviegoing.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Long Way Down, The Illustrated Edition</h2><p><p>After their fantastic motorcycle trip around the world in 2004<i>, </i>bike fanatics and best friends Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman couldn&#x2019;t shake the travel bug. The result was a 15,000-mile adventure throughout the entirety of the African continent on the backs of their trusty BMW motorcycles. Captured here in more than 100 exclusive images are the duo&#x2019;s most memorable experiences, from managing some of the toughest terrain in the world to meeting a bevy of friendly people and encountering astounding natural beauty. With images taken by Ewan and Charley themselves as well as by internationally renowned photographer Julian Broad, this beautifully illustrated edition vividly documents a trip of a lifetime.</p></p><p><p><b>Ewan McGregor</b> first came to notice in Shallow Grave. Since then he has appeared in more than&nbsp;thirty films including <i>Star Wars</i> Episodes I and II and <i>Trainspotting</i>. <b>Charley Boorman</b> has&nbsp;appeared in films such as <i>Excalibur</i>, <i>The Emerald Forest</i> and, more recently, <i>The Bunker</i>.</p><b>1<br>Where's Charley?</b><p>CHARLEY: I remember the moment it started. It was October 2004, very late one Friday night. We were in the old office in Bulwer Street with boxes all around us, bits of paper, all the office equipment gone. For a few minutes we just stood there reflecting. This is where Long Way Round had all begun, where we'd planned everything, checked and re-checked the maps: it's where we'd first seen the bikes.</p><p>It was over, finished: we'd ridden around the world, a mammoth journey; an epic adventure. But it was over now.</p><p>The maps were still on the wall and we stood before them once more. Ewan glanced at me.</p><p>'What do you reckon, Charley?'</p><p>'I don't know.'</p><p>'South America, India maybe?'</p><p>I looked up at him. 'What about riding through Africa?'</p><p>Ewan and I first met on a film set in County Clare more than a dozen years ago, our friendship born out of our passion for motorbikes. We've been best mates ever since. We'd always talked about riding together; France maybe, Spain. But then Ewan walked into a map shop, and over dinner that night we decided to forget France or Spain, we'd go the whole hog and ride around the world. The adventure of a lifetime, the two of us off on a couple of bikes. I wasn't sure we could pull it off; I wasn't sure it would even happen.</p><p>But it did. A late-night conversation became a dream, the dream became an adventure and that adventure proved to be a pivotal point in my life.</p><p>I grew up in the movie business, but I'm dyslexic...and I mean badly: if it hadn't been for my dad taking a year out to teach me to read, life could've been very hard. Even so, reading for acting parts could be difficult sometimes. Historically I'd enjoyed success in movies like <i>The Emerald Forest</i>, but after <i>Long Way Round</i> the direction of my life altered completely. I found myself in places like the pit lane of Moto GP circuits with heroes like Kenny Roberts grabbing my arm and telling me how much he'd enjoyed watching our journey.</p><p>I was no longer just John Boorman's son - in fact my dad rang me up the other day to tell me he'd introduced himself to someone and they'd said, 'Oh, Charley Boorman's dad'.</p><p>My career was now in motorcycling - albeit not in a conventional way - and the success of <i>Long Way Round</i> enabled me to live another dream. Ever since I can remember I'd always wanted to race bikes, so together with Russ Malkin, a very good friend and producer/director of <i>Long Way Round</i>, I entered the world's most dangerous race: the 2006 Dakar rally - five days in January where I rode ridiculous distances at ridiculous speeds before an innocuous crash tipped me off and I broke both my hands. (I never made it to the sand dunes and I've unfinished business there.) That dream was over for now, but another was just beginning.</p><p>Ewan flew in for the end of the Dakar to congratulate us all (my fellow teammate Simon Pavey had made it all the way to the finishing line). He was joined by film maker David Alexanian, the fourth member of the team that created <i>Long Way Round</i>. There we were in Dakar - all together again. And there in the scorching sun we confirmed what we had first mapped out over a year before in Bulwer Street. The adventure was on again - John O'Groats to Cape Town: we would ride the Long Way Down.</p><p>Once my hands were healed, the first thing Ewan and I did was return to the Royal Geographical Society in London, the place where we'd mapped out the first trip. Our bikes parked outside, I took my helmet off. The old red brick building seemed very familiar.</p><p>'So here we are again, Ewan. What do we say to them this time?'</p><p>He laughed. 'How about: Hi, remember us? We're back for more.'</p><p>Inside I quickly recalled how solemn the place felt; the arched windows, blue carpets and the magnificent ancient maps that decked the walls. One in particular dated from 1920 and at the bottom it was engraved with images of the old continent, names and places going back to colonial days when just about every European country fought for a share of the spoils. Ewan pointed to a picture of a guy in a pith helmet in a pretty compromising position with a tribesman. 'Hey, Charley,' he said. 'Here's how you made friends with the natives back then. See, you grabbed a man by his willy.'</p><p>In the journey-planning office we met the same assistant we'd spoken to before and she had yet more large-scale maps spread on a mahogany table.</p><p>'Have you decided on a route?' she asked us.</p><p>I shook my head. 'Nothing definite yet, but we're going to ride down through Europe, I think, probably cross from Sicily.'</p><p>'We'd like to follow the Nile,' Ewan added. 'It's one of those journeys, you know; one of the great trips of the world.'</p><p>She nodded. 'Sudan is pretty unstable and so are parts of Ethiopia. You'll need to be up on your paperwork.'</p><p>I rolled my eyes. 'Jesus, paperwork. The Ukraine, Ewan. Remember?'</p><p>'You mean when we waited nine hours to get in - how could I possibly forget?'</p><p>'Ethiopia is absolutely beautiful though,' the assistant went on, 'and despite the problems they're really trying to build up tourism. Sudan is full of open spaces, the Africa of the movies, if you like.' She smiled then, a little warily. 'There are security issues, however.'</p><p>I cast a glance at Ewan. She was right, as we knew only too well. We'd only just started investigating the route and already knew we'd need armed guards to get us through places like northern Kenya. We were thinking about going into the Democratic Republic of Congo, and weren't sure whether we'd have to go through Zimbabwe. This was going to be a very different journey from Long Way Round, and I think we were only just beginning to realise how different.</p><p>Having reacquainted ourselves with the Royal Geographical Society we headed for the wilds of Devon and a weekend's survival course. The weather was shit, a cold, drizzling rain, and to make things even more miserable, Ewan had his tent up before me. He was crowing about it. I mean, he never gets his tent up before me. It was galling. There was some consolation however: he'd put it up at the bottom of a hill and it was raining, which meant there was every chance he'd have a river running through it before long.</p><p>After that, we got lost in the 'wild wood' whilst hunting for strategically placed survival rations, and then we had to build shelters from fallen branches and bits of foliage.</p><p>Not that we're competitive or anything, but my A-frame and ridge was up, the sides constructed and I was already onto the roof whilst Ewan was still going on about a 'long ridge pole' and the 'bell end' being big enough. After making a wall of branch and fern, the last layer was leaves. Lying inside I could still see daylight and my feet stuck out, though I only discovered that when the instructor kicked them. He proceeded to tell us about a friend of his who went to sleep with his head sticking out of a similar shelter in Africa, only to be woken by a hyena ripping off his face. Our instructor liked telling those kinds of stories: he liked to tell them a lot.</p><p>He was complimentary about my shelter, however, testing thestructural quality by climbing right over it while I was lying inside. In his own words, it didn't budge an inch.</p><p>Ewan was arranging leaves and ferns and other bits and pieces; like a boy scout he was, having a whale of a time. 'Colour coding confuses your enemy,' I heard him mutter.</p><p>Finally he was finished, the branches covered with sprays of fern and leaf. He was stretched out inside and the instructor asked him if he felt confident that it was structurally sound.</p><p>Ewan replied that he did.</p><p>'Good,' the instructor said, 'because I'm going to walk on it.'</p><p>He'd barely shifted his weight when the 'bell end' Ewan had been so proud of collapsed, showering our Jedi Knight in broken branches.</p><p>For a moment there was silence. Then from the depths we heard him: 'Yeah, well, I think obviously there's room for improvement. But generally...' We could see his hands, gesticulating from under the crushed ridge. 'I was quite happy with its...you know, I liked the feel of it and it smelled really nice.'</p><p>On cue and not without a certain sense of ceremony, the rest of the shelter collapsed; a few moments later Ewan emerged: half a beard, his woollen hat askew.</p><p>'Shame,' he said. 'I put a lot of love into that.'</p><p>EWAN: What Charley didn't mention was that his A-frame was put together by the instructor. That's why it was so solid. I did mine myself. Not quite the same thing, is it?</p><p>The instructor really did like his tales of horror: hyenas eating people; elephants trampling our campsite; not to mention the machete-wielding madmen lurking outside every bar. Having said that, he also told us that despite our laid-back attitude, I was 'wily' and Charley was really 'industrious'.</p><p>From Devon, hyenas and elephants, it was Essex and a replica of the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. Driving down a track in a 4x4 we had the feeling we were about to be ambushed. We were right - just as we were considering potential escape routes a mine exploded in front of the truck.</p><p>David Alexanian, who would be joining us on the real trip, was driving. He immediately started backing up. More flash bangs went off, mines, or grenades maybe, exploding behind us.</p><p>Now we heard the rattle of gunfire and a man appeared on our right. Heavily built, he approached the vehicle at a crouch, wearing camouflage and carrying an AK-47. We dived for the doors on the passenger side only to find another guy bellowing at us and brandishing not a gun, but a couple of vicious-looking axes.</p><p>We piled out of the vehicle. Hands in the air, we tried to talk to the gunmen - a whole gang of them now. We tried to explain about UNICEF, and what we were doing. They weren't listening or didn't understand: they didn't care. Before we knew it we were forced away from the vehicles, our captors demanding money, jackets, our watches.</p><p>We'd discussed such a situation with our instructors and they had advised us that in really dangerous areas, convoys of vehicles were put together under armed guard. Our trip was high profile ...</p></p><h2>Goblins and Trolls (FANTASY AND FOLKLORE)</h2><p>Explores the characters of fantasy &amp; folklore and places them in historical context.</p><p></p><h2>Munchkin Vol. 3 (3)</h2><p>Based on the immensely popular card game,&nbsp;Munchkin&nbsp;comes to comics!

As usual, it's oversized?23 stories, nearly 600 pages?and includes a variety of types of SF as well as near-horror, fantasy and humor. Five of the stories are final nominees for Nebulas, and two new "Hainish" stories by Ursula LeGuin were nominated for Tiptree Awards; "The Matter of Segrri" won. No story here is less than competent and professional; but, with a few exceptions, there is a voiceless sameness in the writing, practically a house style, that over so many pages grows tedious. (Nearly half the stories, by page count, come from the Dozois-edited Asimov's Science Fiction.) A number are flawed ("hard" SF stories about "aliens" that think just like humans) or unremarkable, but these are outweighed by many fine pieces and by standouts such as LeGuin's "Forgiveness Day," perhaps the best story in the book; Eliot Fintushel's "New Wave"-like "Ylem"; William Sanders's "Going After Old Man Alabama" and Terry Bisson's "The Hole in the Hole," both of which are winning and funny; Katherine Kerr's chilling "Asylum"; and Michael Bishop's grand and humane "Cri de Coeur." Dozois's intelligently and ably put-together anthology does its stated job as well as any one book or editor could.

Spoto captures well the high kitsch of the twilight of the German aristocracy into which Maria Madgelene Dietrich (1901-92) was born. Her mother drilled the spontaneously honest child never to show her feelings--the birth of the actress's famous mask of alluring remoteness. Ten years of violin lessons trained her for the musical side of her career (her violin teacher deflowered her, she told Billy Wilder) and for some of her funniest and even moving scenes under the direction of Josef von Sternberg, the Svengali who--in The Blue Angel--turned Dietrich into a goddess after many roles in drama school and German silents. The skill, emotional depth, and richness of the actress's finest work (Judgment at Nuremberg) were overshadowed by the sheer emission of star-power in such ``rapturously photographed'' early films as The Devil is a Woman--her own favorite picture--because she was then, Spoto points out, at her most beautiful. Dietrich married early and never divorced (though she remained parted from, if friendly with, her husband) and became a doting mother and grandmother. In private, she was nothing like the insolent indifference of her screen image, but was an intelligent, ambitious creature who was addicted to lengthy long-distance calls and who died a reclusive, wealthy alcoholic. Her lovers included Gary Cooper, John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Yul Brynner, Frank Sinatra--and on and on. Spoto's best biography--warm, well balanced, restrained.

Harwood, Jr., tells the story of one of the most infamous railroad construction projects of the late 19th century. This 200-mile line through Pennsylvania&#x2019;s most challenging mountain terrain was intended to form the heart of a new trunk line from the East Coast to Pittsburgh and the Midwest. Conceived in 1881 by William H. Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie, and a group of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia industrialists, the South Pennsylvania Railroad was intended to break the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x2019;s near-monopoly in the region. The line was within a year of opening when J. P. Morgan brokered a peace treaty that aborted the project and helped bolster his position in the world of finance. The railroad right of way and its tunnels sat idle for 60 years before coming to life in the late 1930s as the original section of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Based on original letters, documents, diaries, and newspaper reports, The Railroad That Never Was uncovers the truth behind this mysterious railway.</p></p><p><p>Herbert H.

After a wonderful career in which he made and lost fortunes, captivated Kings and Queens, and used his genius, wit and eloquence, P.T. Barnum wrote these golden rules for making money.</p><p><br> <br> <b>Phineas Taylor "P. T." Barnum</b> (July 5, 1810 &#x2013; April 7, 1891) was an American politician, showman, and businessman remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes and for founding the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Although Barnum was also an author, publisher, philanthropist, and for some time a politician, he said of himself, "I am a showman by profession...and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me", and his personal aim was "to put money in his own coffers". Barnum is widely, but erroneously, credited with coining the phrase "There's a sucker born every minute". <br> <br> Born in Bethel, Connecticut, Barnum became a small-business owner in his early twenties, and founded a weekly newspaper, before moving to New York City in 1834. He embarked on an entertainment career, first with a variety troupe called "Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater", and soon after by purchasing Scudder's American Museum, which he renamed after himself. Barnum used the museum as a platform to promote hoaxes and human curiosities such as the Feejee mermaid and General Tom Thumb. In 1850 he promoted the American tour of singer Jenny Lind, paying her an unprecedented $1,000 a night for 150 nights. <br> <br> Barnum served two terms in the Connecticut legislature in 1865 as a Republican for Fairfield. With the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution over slavery and African-American suffrage, Barnum spoke before the legislature and said, "A human soul, &#x2018;that God has created and Christ died for,&#x2019; is not to be trifled with. It may tenant the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hottentot &#x2013; it is still an immortal spirit". <br> <br> The circus business was the source of much of his enduring fame. He established "P. T. Barnum's Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan &amp; Hippodrome", a traveling circus, menagerie and museum of "freaks", which adopted many names over the years. Barnum died in his sleep at home in 1891, and was buried in Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport, which he designed himself.</p><h2>Fairy Haven and the Quest for the Wand (A Fairy Dust Trilogy Book)</h2><p>In this best-selling sequel to <i>Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg</i>, Newbery Honor winning author Gail Carson Levine and illustrator David Christiana spin a riveting fairy tale about the dangers of dreams come true.

A first novel. 500,000 first printing.</p><p>Just in time for the millennium, Glenn Kleier mixes bioengineering and religion, miracles and modern warfare, politics and physics to produce a gripping tale set in the Middle East at the dawn of the 21st century. When a mysterious explosion destroys a top-secret laboratory in the Negev desert on Christmas Day 1999, Jonathan Feldman, a reporter, isn't satisfied with the official explanation. Neither is the Vatican, nor an American fundamentalist preacher, nor the patriarch of the Jehovah's Witnesses, all of whom believe that Armageddon may truly be at hand. After a New Year's Eve earthquake strikes the temple at the Well of David and a mysterious figure appears in the ruins, strange things begin to happen. Reports of miracles filter in from throughout the region, and the legend of Jeza takes on a life of its own. When the young miracle worker chooses Jonathan to connect her to the world and broadcast her warning of the cataclysm to come, the world's religious leaders are plunged into conflict. Seeking to discredit her, they spread the secret of her high-tech, bioengineered birth. But their actions backfire; Jeza's influence grows. Holy wars break out in the Middle East and chaos erupts all over the world. As Easter 2000 approaches, the political situation grows even more tense: Will there be another crucifixion, another resurrection? Kleier handles this complicated plot with ease, and fans of futuristic thrillers won't be disappointed. <i>--Jane Adams</i>PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER: "Fascinating debut!"<br> <br> AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BOOKLIST--HOT FICTION (starred review): "This book is so full of hot topics, readers might burn their fingers turning pages.

Humiliated by a hotshot wizard, Nathaniel summons the not-so-tame djinni, Bartimaeus, and sends him to steal the Amulet of Samarkand. Accelerated Reader: Reading Level 5.9, 19 Points.</p><p>Nathaniel is a boy magician-in-training, sold to the government by his birth parents at the age of five and sent to live as an apprentice to a master. Powerful magicians rule Britain, and its empire, and Nathaniel is told his is the "ultimate sacrifice" for a "noble destiny." If leaving his parents and erasing his past life isn't tough enough, Nathaniel's master, Arthur Underwood, is a cold, condescending, and cruel middle-ranking magician in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The boy's only saving grace is the master's wife, Martha Underwood, who shows him genuine affection that he rewards with fierce devotion. Nathaniel gets along tolerably well over the years in the Underwood household until the summer before his eleventh birthday. Everything changes when he is publicly humiliated by the ruthless magician Simon Lovelace and betrayed by his cowardly master who does not defend him.<p> Nathaniel vows revenge. In a Faustian fever, he devours magical texts and hones his magic skills, all the while trying to appear subservient to his master. When he musters the strength to summon the 5,000-year-old djinni Bartimaeus to avenge Lovelace by stealing the powerful Amulet of Samarkand, the boy magician plunges into a situation more dangerous and deadly than anything he could ever imagine. In British author Jonathan Stroud's excellent novel, the first of The Bartimaeus Trilogy, the story switches back and forth from Bartimaeus's first-person point of view to third-person narrative about Nathaniel. Here's the best part: Bartimaeus is absolutely hilarious, with a wit that snaps, crackles, and pops. His dryly sarcastic, irreverent asides spill out into copious footnotes that no one in his or her right mind would skip over. A sophisticated, suspenseful, brilliantly crafted, dead-funny book that will leave readers anxious for more.

All is well until he has a life-changing encounter with Simon Lovelace, a rising, star magician. When Simon brutally humiliates Nathaniel in front of everyone he knows, Nathaniel decides to speed up his magical education, teaching himself spells way beyond his years. Eventually, he masters one of the most difficult spells of all: summoning the all-powerful djinni, Bartimeus.<br><br>But summoning Bartimeus and controlling him are two very different things--and Nathaniel may be in way over his head.</p><h2>Jesus and Mel Gibson&#39;s Passion of the Christ: The Film, the Gospels and the Claims of History</h2><p><p>An exciting and engaging book that will appeal not only to academics but to the film-viewing public, educated lay-persons and students.

Nesbit 1858-1924, was an English author and poet, who wrote or collaborated on more than 60 works of fiction for children, several of which have been adapted for film and television and are still popular today, such as The Treasure Seekers and Five Children and It.Grade 3-5 First published in Strand Magazine in 1899, this story appeared in Nesbit's The Complete Book of Dragons (Macmillan, 1973; o.p.) with pen-and-ink illustrations by Erik Blegvad. Two children save England from being overrun by dragons. Captured by a large child-eating dragon and taken to a cave, they discover the "Universal Tap-room." They half turn off the tap labeled "Sunshine" and turn on the ones called "Fair to moderate" and "Showery" since dragons cannot survive in such weather, "and both taps stuck. . .which accounts for our climate." This single-story edition features large-size pages printed on fine quality paper and 11 beautifully composed watercolors. Zwerger's illustrations enhance the story, which is probably best read to a child who can sit close enough to the reader to examine the pale, evocative pictures closely. Text covers each entire facing page and could be intimidating, thus the book's best use is as a read-aloud. British terminology is generally understood in context, and the turn-of-the-century costuming adds interest. Nesbit's humor and distinctive clear style carry the story briskly along, while Zwerger's illustrations lend it great charm. Susan H.

His innovative verse and provocative attitudes of spiritual, political, and sexual liberation inspired countless poets and musicians, visual and performance artists worldwide, and helped shape several generations' views of the world. </p><p> <em>Selected Poems 1947-1995</em> commemorated Ginsberg's brilliant career as one of America's most distinguished poets. Here are well-known masterpieces such as the lyric "Howl" and the narrative "Kaddish"--classic works of American literature--as well as more recent gems, the long dream poem "White Shroud," the visionary "After Lalon," and the political rock lyric "The Ballad of the Skeletons," a song he recorded in 1996 with a stellar band that included Philip Glass, Lenny Kaye, and Paul McCartney.</p></p><p>Allen Ginsberg made his mark, along with Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder and others, in the Beat movement, a poetry of social protest that refused perceived elitist boundaries. Tortured by the paranoia and mental illness of his immigrant mother, and by his own homosexuality in a society that was homophobic, Ginsberg&#39;s early work was as much a measure of his self-loathing as his detestation of social hypocrisy and injustice. His poems reached depths of humiliation and shame that presaged a mental breakdown, followed by recovery with the help of Buddhist philosophy. His best poetry rises above both personal despair and political propagandizing with satiric comedy, and cheerful self-parody, and is most readily appreciated when read aloud. This volume includes sixty pages of songs, some written in collaboration with Bob Dylan, which are not included in his Collected Poems 1947-1980.<p>Allen Ginsberg was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1926, a son of Naomi and lyric poet Louis Ginsberg. As a student at Columbia College in the 1940s, he began a close friendship with William Burroughs, Neal Cassady, and Jack Kerouac, and he later became associated with the Beat movement and the San Francisco Renaissance in the 1950s. After jobs as a laborer, sailor, and market researcher, Ginsberg published his first volume of poetry, <em>Howl and Other Poems</em>, in 1956. "Howl" defeated censorship trials to become one of the most widely read poems of the century, translated into more than twenty-two languages, from Macedonian to Chinese, a model for younger generations of poets from West to East.</p><p>Ginsberg was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, was awarded the medal of Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French minister of culture, was a winner of the National Book Award (for <em>The Fall of America</em>), and was a cofounder of the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute, the first accredited Buddhist college in the Western world. He died in New York City in 1997.</p></p><h2>City of Darkness, City of Light</h2><p>"FAST-PACED . . . PIERCY BREATHES LIFE INTO THE ACTUAL HISTORICAL FIGURES WHO SHAPED THE REVOLUTION."<br>--San Francisco Examiner &amp; Chronicle<br><br>In her most splendid, thought-provoking novel yet, Marge Piercy brings to vibrant life three women who play prominent roles in the tumultuous, bloody French Revolution--as well as their more famous male counterparts. <br><br>Defiantly independent Claire Lacombe tests her theory: if men can make things happen, perhaps women can too. . . . Manon Philipon finds she has a talent for politics--albeit as the ghostwriter of her husband's speeches. . . . And Pauline L�on knows one thing for certain: the women must apply the pressure or their male colleagues will let them starve. While illuminating the lives of Robespierre, Danton, and Condorcet, Piercy also opens to us the minds and hearts of women who change their world, live their ideals--and are prepared to die for them.<br><br>"MASTERFUL . . . PIERCY BRINGS THE BLOOD AND GUTS, THE IDEAS AND PASSIONS, OF THE REVOLUTION TO LIFE."<br>--The Women's Review of Books<br><br>"PIERCY'S STORYTELLING POWERS CAPTURE THE TURBULENCE AND EXCITEMENT OF [THIS] LIBERATING ERA."<br>--The Boston Herald</p><p>An awkward and agenda-heavy novel, the second this season on the subject of the French Revolution (see Tanith Lee, above). In an author's note, Piercy (The Longings of Women, 1994, etc.), a self-described woman of the left and feminist, declares that she wanted to write about the Revolution and a ``society in crisis''--18th-century France--that might ``illuminate our own situation.'' While the rich in the US may be getting richer and the poor more desperate, however, the US still isn't Royalist France, so the comparisons are less than persuasive. Still, the stories Piercy's six characters--three of them women--tell are vivid, if marred by clich&#x201a;s and colloquialisms (``They're guys just like in the neighborhood''). The narrators, all based on prominent historical figures, include ``Max'' Robespierre, the ascetic absolutist who created the Reign of Terror; Georges Danton, the ebullient orator; Nicholas Condorcet, an intellectual inspired by the example of the American Revolution; Claire Lacombe, an actress and activist; Pauline L&#x201a;on, a chocolate-maker who organized the women; and Manon Roland, whose famous last words were, ``Ah, liberty, what crimes are committed in your name.'' Alternate chapters describe the characters' early lives and their revolutionary roles. Max, who heard his mother die in childbirth, resolved never to have children; Claire ran away from home to escape becoming a laundress like her own mother; Pauline, who grew up poor, married an affluent army officer; Nicholas was an aristocrat who broke with his class; Manon used her intellectual talents to further her husband's career; and Georges wanted to retire to his native province and raise a family. All six witness or participate in events like the storming of the Bastille. But as the ``Revolution begins to eat its children,'' they are caught up in the violence. Only Claire and Pauline survive in a France that is altered, somewhat improved, but still flawed. Dickens did it better. (Quality Paperback Book club featured alternate selection) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Depicting the experiences of three brave women, Piercy (Gone to Soldiers) explores the human reality of the French Revolution, bringing to life the immense role women played in bringing down the monarchy. Claire Lacombe escapes the grinding poverty of her youth by becoming an actress in a traveling troupe. Beautiful and filled with the determination that can be forged by enduring hardship, she becomes an inspiring symbol as she dares to participate in pivotal events. Manon Philipon, a jeweler's daughter, idolizes Rousseau and the life of the mind. Marrying an austere government bureaucrat, she learns that she has an innate grasp of politics. Pauline Leon, the owner of a chocolate shop, is galvanized when she witnesses the executions of poor people rioting for bread. Their three stories are deftly braided with the lives of three men?the incorruptible Robespierre, the opportunistic Danton and Nicolas Caritat, an academician trying to walk the high wire between old and new. Men may be necessary to drive the plot, but women are its engine. It is women who take to the streets looking for "justice, bread and freedom," and who win concessions on issues like divorce and inheritance rights. Piercy skillfully juxtaposes the political debates, painfully slow reforms and bloody confrontations against the ironies and absurdities of everyday life. Since the novel offers multiple perspectives, events sometimes overlap and readers must pay close attention to the dates listed with chapter headings. This is a minor obstacle, however, in a novel that adds fresh, powerfully grounding perspective to accepted historical fact.

Technology went on expanding. So did man&#39;s ambitions. But there was a danger only dimly suspected and only poorly comprehended when it began to make itself felt. It was that man&#39;s ambition would out-leap his imagination; that his technology would outstrip his emotional capacity. It might be that it was just too big, the universe.

In the West, Jihad is often associated with violence and fanaticism. Muslims, however, emphasize that the real meaning is "effort toward a religiously commendable aim" and that it can be applied to both defensive warfare and peaceful activities for the sake of religion.<br>The aim of the present book is to elucidate the concept of Jihad. It provides basic reading materials translated from Arabic and Turkish, an introduction, and two essays on modernist and fundamentalist interpretations and the significance of Jihad nowadays. The translations include hadiths (sayings and deeds of the Prophet Mohammed), excerpts from al-Muwatta' of Malik Ibn Anas (d. 796) exhorting Muslims to participate in Jihad, the legal doctrine of Jihad as expounded by the famous philosopher and jurist Averroes (d. 1198), and a treatment of its religious and moral aspects by Ibn Tamiyya (d. 1328). A treatise on Jihad by the late rector of the famous al-Azhar University in Cairo, Mahmud Shaltut (d. 1963), rounds out the collection.</p><p>Rudolph Peters is a professor at the University of Amsterdam.To Americans and Europeans, the word jihad conjures up fanatical Arab warriors overwhelming a Crusader citadel. Jihad ("struggle") denotes holy war for Islam, and in this sense is comparable to crusade, holy war for Christianity. But there is much more to jihad than this. One may struggle not only against an enemy outside Islam, but against heretics within, social evils like poverty and crime, and unbelief in oneself. Peters, a professor at the University of Amsterdam and the director of the Netherlands Institute in Cairo, has collected previously published information (six translations of Arabic texts, and two of his own articles) to help us understand the wider social and moral senses of jihad. While Peters terms this material "basic," it is both highly technical and complex, and presupposes some familiarity with Islam and its history. It will appeal to the scholar and specialist, not to the casual reader.?James F. DeRoche, Alexandria, Va.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom</h2><p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt stands astride American history like a colossus, having pulled the nation out of the Great Depression and led it to victory in the Second World War. Elected to four terms as president, he transformed an inward-looking country into the greatest superpower the world had ever known. Only Abraham Lincoln did more to save America from destruction. But FDR is such a large figure that historians tend to take him as part of the landscape, focusing on smaller aspects of his achievements or carping about where he ought to have done things differently. Few have tried to assess the totality of FDR's life and career.<br><br> Conrad Black rises to the challenge. In this magisterial biography, Black makes the case that FDR was the most important person of the twentieth century, transforming his nation and the world through his unparalleled skill as a domestic politician, war leader, strategist, and global visionary--all of which he accomplished despite a physical infirmity that could easily have ended his public life at age thirty-nine. Black also takes on the great critics of FDR, especially those who accuse him of betraying the West at Yalta. Black opens a new chapter in our understanding of this great man, whose example is even more inspiring as a new generation embarks on its own rendezvous with destiny.</p><p><b>Conrad Black</b> was the chairman and chief executive officer of Hollinger International Inc., among whose newspaper holdings are the <i>Daily and Sunday Telegraph</i> and <i>The Spectator</i> in London, the <i>Chicago Sun-Times,</i> and the <i>Jerusalem Post.</i> He is the author of two previous books published in Canada and became a member of the British House of Lords as Lord Black of Crossharbour in 2001. He divides his time between London, Toronto, and New York.Flying over the Nile near Cairo in October 1943, President Roosevelt looked down and quipped, "Ah, my friend the Sphinx." Sometimes portrayed that way by cartoonists in his time, he is utterly unsphinxlike in Lord Black's new biography. Massive and moving, barbed yet balanced, it is scrupulously objective and coldly unsparing of agenda-ridden earlier biographers and historians. It leaps to the head of the class of Rooseveltian lives and will be difficult to supersede. To Black, the Canadian-born media mogul (he owns the London Daily Telegraph and the Chicago Sun-Times, among other papers worldwide), the second Roosevelt was, apart from Lincoln perhaps as savior of the Union, the greatest American president, and with no exceptions the greatest of its politicians. No FDR-haters have exposed, credibly, more of Roosevelt's "less admirable tendencies," from "naked opportunism," "deformed idealism" and "pious trumpery" to "insatiable vindictiveness." Yet the four-term president emerges in Black's compelling life as personifying vividly the civilization he, more than any other contemporary, rescued from demoralizing economic depression and devastating world war. His larger-than-life Roosevelt possesses consummate sensitivity and tactical skill, radiating power and panache despite a physical vulnerability from the polio that left him without the use of his legs at 39. "His insight into common men," Black writes, "was the more remarkable because he was certainly not one of them, and never pretended for an instant that he was." By comparison, Black claims, most associates and rivals seemed like kindergarten children, yet some exceptions are fleshed out memorably, notably Roosevelt's selfless political intimates Louis McHenry Howe and Harry Hopkins, and his vigorous presidential competitor in 1940, the surprising Wendell Willkie. (Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor, comes off as both harridan and heroine.) Barring occasional lapses into English locutions like "Boxing Day" and "Remembrance Day"(the days after Christmas and Armistice Day), or "drinking his own bathwater," Conrad's style is lucid and engaging, witty and acerbic, with lines that cry out to be quoted or read aloud, as when he scorns an attack on the devotion of Roosevelt's daughter, Anna, with "Filial concern does not make the President a vegetable or his daughter a Lady Macbeth." A few minor historical errors deserve correction in what will assuredly be further printings, and the later sections appear to be composed in undue haste, but the sweeping and persuasive impact of this possibly off-puttingly big book makes it not only the best one-volume life of the 32nd president but the best at any length, bound to be widely read and discussed. 32 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sing-Along Fun: Row, Row, Row Your Boat</h2><p><p><b>Exciting new sing-along series with stunning illustrations to engage and entertain little ones!</b></p><p>This Sing-Along Fun series brings to life some of the most famous nursery rhymes.

The towering masters of post-impressionism, most notably Cezanne, van Gogh, Gauguin, and Seurat, are among the most beloved artists in the entire canon of western painting. Fortunately, they are well represented in many American museums. Less seen by the public are the fabulous holdings in private collections and in the more out-of-the-way public collections abroad. The opportunity to gather together some of the major achievements of these four artists from all these sources would in itself be cause for rejoicing. In addition to this the National Gallery has the opportunity to present an exhibition that goes far beyond this limited selection. So dazzled have we become by the achievements of the major figures working in France that we have tended to scant the complex and fascinating context of artistic experimentation that characterizes this fecund period, not only in France but in countries across Europe and in the United States. This exhibition is the first in which that context has been so comprehensively examined. For the American version, however, the size of the exhibition has been reduced by almost a third; the focus sharpened, with a greater concentration on a smaller number of artists; the span of the show precisely defined between 1880 and 1906, the year of Cezanne&#39;s death; and an American section added. It had been, in fact, the original intention of the organizers to include the work of American artists, and they were delighted when the Gallery offered its curator of American painting, John Wilmerding, who collaborated with Professor Wanda Corn to select this additional section and write the texts accompanying it. The original catalogue, a model of its kind, has already become an art-historical reference work; this present publication records the show in its new form, with an abbreviated version of the original introduction, brief essays for each country and biographical sketches for each artist.</p><p></p><h2>Feersum Endjinn</h2><p>Living the last of his eight lives, Count Alandre Sessine VIII races against time to defuse a lethal conspiracy on its way to Earth, while a betrayer is fast on his heels</p><p>In a future where the ancients have long since departed Earth for the stars, those left behind live complacent lives filled with technological marvels they no longer understand.

Throw in his penchant for global cooking and his expansive culinary skill set and you have the perfect recipe for a great cookbook author. His first effort is thrilling, reliable and insanely sexy...but most importantly the food is as delicious and sensible.

His book will serve as both inspiration and guide to many meals in my home for years to come. (Gail Simmons)<br><br>Sosa believes in the science of flavor and the art of cooking. He categorizes recipes by the primary tastes the tongue physically senses: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. To those fundamentals he adds spicy, earthy, and nutty. Out of this palette of flavors he creates unique recipes that harmonize these attributes. Scallop and banana tartare offers a basic sweetness, which is underscored by dressing it with jalape�o vinaigrette for contrasting acidity and spiciness. Salty flavor dominates in Sosa&#x2019;s remarkable riff on Chinese takeout standard General Tso&#x2019;s chicken reimagined with sweetbreads. Even more startling, sloppy Ho Chi Minh revolutionizes an American classic with Vietnamese flavors. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Chef Angelo Sosa combines flavors in surprisingly delicious ways. His unique cooking style comes from many influences: his Dominican-Italian heritage, French culinary training, time spent working with chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, competing on Top Chef, and traveling in Asia. He brings these experiences to bear in this inviting cookbook, sharing 100 exciting, globally inspired recipes. Some are jazzed-up versions of familiar fare: Mustard Seed Potato Salad, for example, or Sloppy Ho Chi Minh, an exotic riff on the classic Sloppy Joe. Others are wildly original, like Curried Pots de Cr�me and Grilled Watermelon with Chinese A-1 Sauce. The flavors are innovative and complex, but the cooking, generally, is not.

Abraham Lincoln is a circuit-riding lawyer, a member of the state legislature, a man of almost ungovernable ambition. To his friends he is also a beloved figure, by turns charmingly awkward and mesmerizingly self-possessed&#x2014;a man of whom they, too, expect big things. Among his friends and political colleagues are Joshua Speed, William Herndon, Stephen Douglas, and many others who have come to the exploding frontier town of Springfield to find their futures.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It is through another friend, a fictional poet, Cage Weatherby, that we will come to know Lincoln in his twenties and thirties, as a series of formative, surprising incidents unfolds&#x2014;his service in the Black Hawk War, his participation in a poetry-writing society, a challenge to a duel that begins as a farce but quickly rises to lethal potential . . . Cage both admires and clashes with Lincoln, sometimes questioning his legal ethics and his cautious stance on slavery. But he is by Lincoln&#x2019;s side as Lincoln slips back and forth between high spirits and soul-hollowing sadness and depression, and as he recovers from a disastrous courtship of one woman to marry the beautiful, capricious, politically savvy Mary Todd. It is Mary who will bring stability to Lincoln&#x2019;s life, but who will also trigger a conflict that sends the two men on very different paths into the future.<br><br>Historically accurate, rich in character, filled with the juice and dreams and raw ambitions of Americans on the make in an early frontier city,<i> A Friend of Mr. Lincoln</i> is a revelatory and moving portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in his young manhood.

He lives in Austin, Texas.<br><br>www.stephenharrigan.comone<br><br>The line to see the president moved slowly, stuporously, six citizens abreast. It began somewhere in the disordered crowd that had jammed the city square and inched past uniformed guards to the wrought-�iron fence surrounding the statehouse. Micajah Weatherby shuffled forward with the rest, thinking he might be greeted at any moment by a friendly, astonished voice. &#x201c;Cage Weatherby! By God, you&#x2019;re in Springfield? What are you doing waiting in this line with everyone else? Come with me at once. Why, of all the people he wouldn&#x2019;t want standing out here in the heat!&#x201d;<br><br>He doubted, though, that anyone would recognize him. He was fifty-�four, rather portly now, though only a few years earlier he had been as athletically trim as when he and the rest of the young blades of Springfield used to play fives against the brick walls behind the square. But the violent loss of his left arm had given him a disinclination to take exercise at a time when the driving purpose of his middle-�aged body was to accumulate mass. So he was incognito: forgotten, fat, one-�armed, his face hidden beneath the bushy whiskers of the age.<br><br>The odds were not certain that he would recognize anyone in return: all those once familiar faces, clean-�shaven in the long ago but now doubtless also obscured by beards, and fleshy or slack with age. His old friends, unseen for so many years, would have missing teeth, thinning hair, stooped and tired stances. Perhaps one of them was standing within arm&#x2019;s reach&#x2014;�Joshua Speed, or Ashbel Merritt. No, if they were here they would not be waiting in line with all the barbers and storekeepers and mechanics. They would be inside already, in a special room set aside for them.<br><br>Although they began letting the crowd in at midmorning, it was noon before Cage was finally inside the statehouse and upstairs in the Hall of Representatives. There the line that had been moving so sluggishly was parted in two by the guards and suddenly accelerated, flowing around the catafalque with a disorienting swiftness. Perhaps that was for the best, because when Cage finally saw the face in the coffin he had to fight back the instinct to shut his eyes and shove his way back down the stairs.<br><br>He was on more familiar terms with death than most, even in those terrible years. But this was Abraham Lincoln, and this was death in a new register: more profound, more final, as bewildering to him as if he were encountering the unthinkable phenomenon for the first time. It was strangely silent in that venerable public place. Everyone was too stunned to weep. Nevertheless, he could feel his composure eroding. He was glad the procession had not been any slower. He did not want to look at that face a moment more.<br><br>He was too unsettled to see it clearly. He just had the impression of something truly and obscenely dead, dead for weeks and now, for all the grim majesty of the surroundings, cheaply and shockingly displayed. It was obvious the body should have been long underground. The banks of flowers and evergreens were meant to hide the scent of putrefaction, but they only made it more obvious. His face&#x2014;�could that really be, have been, his friend Lincoln&#x2019;s face?&#x2014;�was a moldering mess, collapsing in on itself beneath a glaring white shell of chalk and rouge.<br><br>When Cage looked up from the coffin he met the eyes of some poor girl from the Philharmonic Society. She looked stricken as she lent her voice to the choir&#x2019;s soothing hymn, trying to keep from fainting in the crowded, close room, the windows draped, the gas lit, the mourners passing by in their unending multitudes, glancing down one by one with the same expression of solemn horror. He felt sorry for her, imprisoned in this hothouse with a corroding corpse, under the press of an entire nation&#x2019;s sorrow.<br><br>He filed out with the others beneath various mottoes that had been put up among the greenery and the black droopers. &#x201c;Washington the Father, Lincoln the Saviour.&#x201d; &#x201c;Though dead, he yet speaketh.&#x201d; He made his way downstairs through the south door and into the blessed May air, where the smell of the lilac blossoms was unforced and no longer in service as a fragrant assault on decay. The whole square, the whole city, was covered in black. The massive columns of the county courthouse across Sixth Street had been turned into funereal barber poles with their swirling bands of black and white.<br><br>The people who were not in line to see the body, or who were not standing about aimlessly on the streets, were walking en masse from one place to the next where Lincoln had lived, where he had worked, to see the things that his now-�sacred hands had touched. Cage walked with them, just another stranger in town, another grieving curious tourist, and found himself at the house at Eighth and Jackson that Lincoln and Mary had bought back in the forties, not long before they had mostly vanished from his life. The house had only one story back then. It had soon enough been turned into a capacious two-�level dwelling of a prosperous man of the law. Cage had never seen it from the inside&#x2014;�never invited, thanks to Mary.<br><br>The people who lived in the house now had opened it up to the curious. Cage reckoned they had no choice. If the doors had not been open the crowds would have taken them off their hinges and carted them away. As it was, those who were not lined up at the front door to see the rooms were busy plucking blades of grass and blossoms from the garden bed, and there were even children scraping paint chips off the walls to take home as holy relics. The house paint was a pale brown, which mixed queasily with the black curtains and valances.<br><br>His own thoughts were as darkly shrouded as Lincoln&#x2019;s house. After many years away he had come back to the raw political boomtown&#x2014;�grown now into an almost unrecognizable city&#x2014;�that had been his home as a young man. But there was no sense of nostalgia, no warm ache of times past and lives flown. He had done his best to keep his mind trained forward, to stay ahead of the hypo, but today he sensed a collapsing darkness, a black thing pawing at his mind. He wondered: Is this what it had been like for Abraham Lincoln? Was this the sort of anguish he experienced every time his smile faded and he disappeared into that melancholic stillness of his?<br><br>By a freakish good fortune in timing he had managed to get a room at the Chenery House; otherwise he would have had to pay for the privilege of sleeping on the floor in some crowded boardinghouse, or bivouacking in a tent on the outskirts of town. He was glad he had the room to return to now, someplace to go to purge himself of this bile of despair. He made his way against the crowds surging toward the Lincoln house and walked back to the center of town, wiping away the sweat that poured down onto his face from the tight brim of his hat. Once in his room he took off his coat and collar and threw himself on the bed. When he woke, it was hours later, almost dusk. It took him another half hour to shake off the stupefaction of emerging from such a fierce nap.<br><br>He went down into the crowded lobby to read the papers, disturbingly avid for every detail of the assassination and how it had unfolded. He noticed that even the opposition papers were still publishing &#x201c;Breaking Through the Ice,&#x201d; the poem he had written in one sitting in a fury the night of Lincoln&#x2019;s murder. He had had no thought of trying to rekindle his career with it. Writing the poem had been as raw an act of grief as letting out a wail. But he had shown it to a friend at the Chicago Tribune and it had come out the next day on the front page, and was immediately reprinted in papers across the country, then issued as broadsides and handbills and read aloud on courthouse steps and even, he was told, set to music. He did not think it his best work, but it was unguarded and almost untouched by the vanity and yearning for literary immortality that had driven him in the old days. That his name was now famous for one spontaneous poem, and not for the product of years of passionate, concentrated labor, was an irony easily absorbed when so much shattering change was in the air.<br><br>Seward would survive being knifed in his bed, he learned from the pages of The Illinois State Journal. Harrold&#x2019;s trial was under way, and the captors of Booth were quarreling among themselves about the division of the reward. The papers were declaring that as many as three hundred people had been part of the conspiracy, but he rather doubted that. And then there was, as always, the war itself to read about. Richmond had fallen a month ago, and according to the latest dispatch from New Orleans Kirby Smith had surrendered, but who could be sure it would not all flare up again, or degenerate into something that was no longer a defined war but a series of dirty reprisals and counter-�reprisals that would last for generations and destroy the Union after all?<br><br>He had missed his lunch. It was a good sign that he was hungry. The shock and sadness of Lincoln&#x2019;s death were still acute but the conviction that existence itself was a cruel and static thing had evaporated in the afternoon&#x2019;s sleep.<br><br>There was a long wait for a table in the hotel&#x2019;s dining room, and every other eating place and tavern in town was full as well. He went instead to the new Masonic Lodge, whose doors had been thrown open to the public and tables set up to create a temporary dining hall. It was an efficient operation and the line moved quickly. He did not mind, on this evening, sharing a table with strangers. Grief, like danger, excites the herding impulse.<br><br>He sat with a family from Alton. The father was a widowed manager of a lard-�oil factory who had brought his three daughters and his late wife&#x2019;s blind mother to Springfield for the funeral. The man had seen Cage struggling to balance his cup and plate of stew with one hand and had rushed to his aid and ushered him to the table his family had claimed in the corner of the lodge. They wanted to know if he was a resident of Springfield and, if so, if he had known the president. Cage told them he had not lived in the city for almost twenty years, which was true, and that though he had seen Mr. Lincoln back then walking through the streets from time to time he had never known him or even been introduced to him, which was blatantly false. He excused himself of the lie readily enough. He told himself he did not want to aggrandize himself in this somber moment by impressing listeners with his intimate stories of long ago. That was true, but the starker truth was that it would hurt to tell those stories, to remember too acutely.<br><br>The youngest of the girls, ten or eleven years old, kept glancing at his empty sleeve. He was an old man to her and she could not have imagined that he might have lost his arm actually fighting in the war. Her father wanted to talk about Old Bob, the president&#x2019;s suddenly famous horse, whom the family had admired that afternoon as the animal posed for photographers outside the Lincoln home. They had also been among the first in line that morning at the statehouse. The blind mother-�in-�law said that although she could not see the president she had felt his spirit as she moved past the coffin. She experienced this as an unexpected flood of gladness and peace.<br><br>The father was a nervous, plan-�ahead sort of man. He wanted to know Cage&#x2019;s thoughts about the funeral tomorrow. Where was the best place to form up so that they wouldn&#x2019;t be at the trailing edge of the procession? Would there be such a crush of people that the cemetery would not hold them all? Was it true that Mrs. Lincoln was still back in Washington, too grief-�stricken to even attend her own husband&#x2019;s funeral?<br><br>He offered what insights he could, but was already thinking he might miss the funeral himself, leave town on the first train to Chicago. He had seen enough history firsthand. He did not need to be crowding in to see more. And there was a kind of sting in knowing he would not be at the front of the procession, not walking beside the hearse as a pallbearer. Old Bob now had more of a claim to Lincoln than he did.<br><br>After dinner, out on the streets at night, he felt foolishly alone. He was homesick for San Francisco, which he had not seen now in almost four years: the sea lions barking on the wharves, the moist, seeping fog; sights and sensations that had been unimaginable to him as a young man living on the Illinois prairie. Now Springfield itself was almost as foreign as California had once been. The streets were brightly lit with gas lamps and planked over&#x2014;�no more muddy hog holes to swallow up unwary pedestrians. All the buildings on the square were of brick. Most of the wooden buildings were gone, including the Palatine, the lodging house he had once owned. Chicken Row had burned down in a fire. In its place were stalwart new structures housing jewelry stores and haberdashers. There was a new governor&#x2019;s mansion, new halls and bank buildings, a new market house. The people promenading along the sidewalks tonight on their Abraham Lincoln memorial tour, buying slices of pie and card photographs of the Lincolns&#x2019; dog from opportunistic vendors, were not just strangers to him but proof of his own ghostly irrelevance.<br><br>He walked south to Aristocracy Hill, where Ninian Edwards&#x2019;s grand house still stood, looking much the same as it had when he and the other ambitious young men of Springfield had congregated there for hops and balls and windy political talk, arrogant enough to believe that any room that held them was the staging ground of their futures. Those futures were now revealed&#x2014;�certainly Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s was. He was venerably dead now, sealed already within a tomb of myth. Would anyone ever really believe he had once been young&#x2014;�young and confused and desperate for success?<br><br>As for Cage Weatherby, his future appeared to him on this bleak night to be just a listless pageant of increasing obscurity and age.<br><br>After another hour of wandering in the warm May darkness he walked back through the square on the way to his hotel and stopped on the corner of Washington and Fifth, remembering. Of course: this was where Speed&#x2019;s store had been. But it was not here anymore. It had been demolished or burned down and then swallowed up by another modern brick row....</p><h2>Batman: The Offical Book of the Movie</h2><p>Looks at the history of the Batman comicbook character, describes the making of the film, including its special effects and design, and describes the roles of its main stars</p><p></p><h2>Eyewitness: World War I (Eyewitness Books)</h2><p>Discover the misery of life in the trenches -- and how the Great War devastated Europe.

But when Roderick's half-sister Cordelia asks to visit and look through Benedict's papers, things liven up. Their father's illegitimate daughter, she is writing a biography of her mother, Dame Myra Mason, a renowned actress whose rancorous break-up with their father had been much publicized. The biography will be more in the line of an expose, Cordelia having been emotionally abused by her mother, and no one is surprised when Dame Myra herself shows up to put a stop to it. When she is murdered in the local pub that night a host of possible suspects, led of course by Cordelia, is revealed. After some admirable and intuitive sleuthing by Chief Inspector Meredith identifies the murderer and accomplice, a secret long harbored by Caroline and Roderick is also disclosed. Appealing and distasteful characters alike make this another highly entertaining diversion from the author of The Skeleton in the Grass , Out of the Blackout , etc. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.No one loved the murdered Dame Myra Mason, long-ago plaything of now senile Benedict Cotterel.

She&#39;s arrived in Ireland to drag the Irish crime lab into the 21st century, plus keep tabs on her Irish-born father who&#39;s increasingly seeking solace in the bottle. But a brutal serial killer soon puts paid to that.</p><p><b>CSI Reilly Steel &nbsp;series:</b><i><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Books can be read standalone in any order, but are best enjoyed in sequence</i>.<br>#0 CRIME SCENE (Series Prequel)<br>#1 SERIAL (aka TABOO)<br>#2 INFERNO<br>#3 HIDDEN<br>#4 THE WATCHED#5 TRACE#6 AFTERMATH#7 ENDGAMEReilly sat at her desk, her features screwed up in an expression of intense concentration as she studied the crime-scene inventory for the Clare Ryan case. It was a couple of days after the shooting and nearly all the staff had long since left for the day.<br> To most people, the clinical setting and the oppressive silence - broken only by the low hum of the machinery - would feel eerie and discomfiting. For Reilly, however, the peace and quiet of late evening was her preferred time to work. <br> Now that everyone had gone home, she was free from the noisy distractions of twenty or so laboratory staff laboring all around her. The silence allowed her more time to work, more time to think, and tonight it might allow her uncover what it was about this shooting that had been niggling at her for the last two days.<br> She'd sensed from the start that something wasn't right but so far had found nothing out of the ordinary amongst the evidence to back this feeling up. The two things she trusted most during an investigation were evidence and instinct. And since leaving that scene, Reilly's instincts were screaming that something was seriously amiss. <br> Gorman would have laughed if she'd tried to explain this to him. The long-time incumbent, he was head of the old forensic department and hadn't exactly been over the moon about her appointment, or the setting up of the new unit in general. She was glad that the old man would be away on vacation for a while; it gave her an opportunity to run this case the way she wanted - the way she was trained to do back home. <br> Since she'd arrived at the GFU he'd tried to put her in her place, inferring that her job was just to oversee work in the lab, and that she should have little or no interference in what he was doing, or had done, up to now. While this was true to a degree, from what Reilly had seen, the older man's current methods were pretty half-hearted and pedantic considering it was such an important role, and the old dog had no interest in new tricks. <br> On top of it, Gorman had an unbelievable ego - something she'd at least been forewarned about before she got here. Like many traditional scientists, he seemed to operate under the belief that his word was gospel and he was also a condescending old chauvinist - something she could handle were he not such a sloppy investigator with it. Still she resented the way he spoke to the female staff, particularly Lucy, who was a real sweetie and Reilly knew was routinely wounded by her superior's dismissiveness.<br> But office politics aside, Reilly also had to deal with the force's natural resistance to an 'outsider', to say nothing of the inevitable dumb blond jokes. She shook her head, recalling how, on her very first day at the office, she'd come out of a morning meeting to find a crimson Baywatch-style swimsuit laid out on her desk. No doubt the culprit and his buddies found it hilarious but it was water off a duck's back to Reilly; she'd had to deal with a lot worse back in her FBI student days.<br> She looked again at the evidence for the Ryan homicide. This was one of the first scenes she'd managed to co-ordinate entirely on her own, outside of Gorman's interference. Without him breathing down her neck, she'd had as much time as she wanted to run the scene in as much detail as possible. And plenty of time to apply her 'touchy-feely' techniques, she thought, biting back a smile as she recalled the reaction <i>that</i> had gotten.<br> It was something she'd learned and perfected at Quantico. Her lecturer, Rob Crichton, one of the best forensic investigators in the business, had drilled into his recruits the importance of the three-dimensional crime scene. She smiled fondly, recalling the now deceased Crichton - an anti-personnel device at a perp's apartment having put an end to the life of one of the best criminalists she'd ever had the fortune to work with. Although his death was a tragedy, she figured that Rob would have appreciated the irony of his body being blown to smithereens. He himself finally becoming the physical evidence he'd spent much of his life collecting. <br> 'Your senses are there for a reason, people,' he used to say. 'Never, <i>ever</i> discount them.'<br> While Reilly had initially been sceptical, she soon discovered when she applied Rob's painstaking methods that she had an unusually keen sense of smell - something that had been invaluable in almost every case she worked. For some reason, she was particularly attuned to perfume and could draw easily on her inner database of various fragrance brands and body creams. For example, she knew that the ME, Karen Thompson favored Red Door by Elizabeth Arden, and that Carol, the GFU receptionist routinely wore CK One<i>.</i> Oddly, she'd noticed that Chanel No. 5, the American woman's favorite had a far less fervent following on this side of the Atlantic.<br> Either way, her instincts had served her well in the past and she wasn't about to discard them just because some red-nosed Irish cop thought they were dumb and irrelevant. All mouth and little substance; Reilly could eat a guy like Kennedy for breakfast - not that she wanted to, she thought, shuddering at the notion. He seemed OK, just old school. She'd heard his partner's name mentioned a few times over the last couple of months; Chris Delaney seemed to have a good reputation within the force, and unlike some of his more conservative colleagues, also seemed to be well disposed toward the GFU. She figured that those dark, almost Mediterranean looks must work well when it came to extracting information - particular from the female side of the population - although from what little she knew about him, he didn't seem the type to play on that. And in contrast to Kennedy, he certainly hadn't given her any attitude that morning, and seemed happy to take on board anything significant the lab might come up with. <br> Which, at the moment, wasn't exactly much.<br> They'd sent blood samples off for a toxicology screen which, if they came back positive, might - for the shooter at least - go some way toward explaining his actions. However, with the speed the labs worked at, who knew when she'd get those back.<br> They'd also collected the usual - fingerprints, trace, and fibers - which were now being analyzed. Ballistics were in possession of the gun and cartridges, and Reilly was planning on calling down there the following morning to see if they'd come up with anything of interest. <br> In the meantime, she was doing what she did best, going over the scene in her mind, trying to recreate the kill, taking into account the evidence they'd uncovered, and hoping for something, anything, that might just help move this case forward. <br> But so far, all Reilly could come up with was that something didn't feel right. <br> She sat forward in her seat and for the umpteenth time picked up the photos of the victims taken at the scene before their removal. Again, she studied the blood and brain spatter on the headboard; much of the gray matter had spewed over the dead girl's face and hair - some even landing as far away as the pile of books on her bedside table. The blowback blood droplets on the headboard and wall behind were to be expected, traveling in the opposite direction to the path of the bullet. Her gaze moved downward to the gun's resting position on the bed where it had ended up after falling out of the dead shooter's hand. <br> <i>What was it?</i> she thought, kneading her forehead in the vain hope that the answer might somehow be released. What was it that about this whole situation that was bothering her? Given the gun's caliber, trajectory and shooting distance, as well as the residue found on the guy's hand, the results all looked consistent, yet there was something telling her that there was more to this, that she was missing something. Something important. <br> But what? <br> Chasing evidence, hoping to find answers - sometimes Reilly felt it was all she'd been doing her whole life.</p><h2>Unmasking Male Depression: Recognizing the Root Cause to Many Problem Behaviors Such as Anger, Resentment, Abusiveness, Silence, Addictions, and Sexual Compulsiveness</h2><p>Depression is a secret pain at the core of many men's lives, and one that goes largely undiagnosed and untreated.

An American doctor, Bostonian, and patriot, Joseph Warren played a central role in the events leading to the American Revolution. This detailed biography of Warren rescues the figure from obscurity and reveals a remarkable revolutionary who dispatched Paul Revere on his famous ride and was the hero of the battle of Bunker Hill, where he was killed in action. Physician to the history makers of early America, political virtuoso, and military luminary, Warren comes to life in this comprehensive biography meticulously grounded in original scholarship.</p><p></p></p><p>"Had Warren failed at the Siege of Boston, the Continental Congress and all its high ideals would have come to nothing. Warren's insistence, during that formative precedent-setting interlude, on the strict separation of representative government from a subordinate military, is an enduring contribution to the American experience. It was a gift he purchased with his life. America owes Warren much, the least of which is knowing his story and understanding his aspect of our nation's beginnings." <br> - Paul Bracken, professor of political science, Yale University, and author of <i>Fire in the East: The Rise of Asian Military Power and the Second Nuclear Age</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Joseph Warren conducted what was surely the most unusual medical practice in America's early history. He collected key military intelligence prior to the Revolutionary War from a network of spies acting as patients and was among early American doctors to use dead bodies for anatomical study. However, that is only part of his story. By virtue of directing the original Minute Men, Warren is considered a founder of the Army National Guard. He served as president of the 1775 Massachusetts Provincial Congress, where he advocated for a military accountable only to elected government, and as a Freemasonry Grand Master. Finally, as a military general, Warren was the first high-ranking American officer killed during the Revolutionary War. This definitive biography is accompanied by an enlightening series of appendices, which include a forensic reconstruction of the doctor's account books. Dr. Samuel A. Forman has a personal mission to increase enthusiasm for American core values. He became intrigued by the references to Joseph Warren, whose r�sum� defied belief that one person could do many things, much less do them simultaneously, well, and frequently lead them. Early in his research for this book, Forman attended lectures on the American Revolution by Prof. David Hackett Fischer, Pulitzer Prize winner and best-selling author of books on the era, who commented that "it may take a physician to tell Warren's story properly." Making sense of opaque eighteenth-century physician's account books, a feat of both forensic analysis and medical historical scholarship, turned out to be the elusive key to understanding Joseph Warren's life experiences. It is an accomplishment that only a scholar-physician could hope to achieve. A father of five, Forman lives in Brookline, Massachusetts."Sam Forman has applied meticulous scholarship and an engaging style to resurrect a medical life among American founding figures. Readers will be amazed at personal and clinical details of what was surely the most unusual medical practice in all of America's history. After reading [this book], my understanding of America's Revolutionary heritage will never be the same." <br> - William M. McDermott, Jr., MD executive vice president (retired) of the Massachusetts Medical Society, publishers of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> <br><br>Joseph Warren, the forgotten founding father, passionately blended ideology and action-organizing the real Boston Tea Party, leading the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, sending Paul Revere on his iconic ride, and heroically fighting at the Battle of Bunker Hill, where he was killed in action. He has had a broad and lasting impact, deserving of a more prominent place in American memory. Beloved and famous in his time for his political and military exploits, Warren was also idolized by former presidents John Adams and Ronald Reagan as a martyr to the American cause and as one of our most inspirational historical personalities. This fascinating biography sheds light on his illicit activities as a resurrectionist obtaining dead bodies for anatomical study, his deep friendship with famous patients like John and Abigail Adams, his authorship of the foundational Suffolk Resolves, the spy ring he ran out of his medical practice on the eve of the Revolutionary War, an alleged relationship with the stunning wife of the enemy general as a source of military intelligence, and the arc of his posthumous legacy from the pinnacle of fame to obscurity, and perhaps back again. Warren was a humanitarian, devoting his career to improving health care for all and making real the concepts of liberty and representative government. <br><br>Meticulously grounded in original scholarship, this is the definitive biography of American founder Dr. Joseph Warren. Scholar-physician Samuel A. Forman has adapted innovative methods in historiography, medicine, and forensics to produce a rousing volume worthy of its subject.</p><h2>Dawn of the Golden Promise (An Emerald Ballad #5)</h2><p>Chronicles the challenges and triumphs of a nineteenth-century Irish American family and their ties to the homeland</p><p><b>B.

And we all remember the Depression-era classic "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?" But very few can name the man who put the words to these celebrated hallmarks of American music- Yip Harburg. Five hundred songs spanning a fifty-year career bear witness to the brilliance of this until-now obscure figure.<br>Plunge into this scrupulously documented volume and discover how Harburg, once a poet of light verse, played a major role in the transformation of the Broadway revue into the sophisticated musical of the 1940s and 1950s. With extensive and exclusive interviews and lyrical analysis, the authors capture Harburg's wit, distinctive voice, and creative and collaborative methods.<br>Inquiry into Harburg's Jewish, New York City roots, apprenticeship in his craft, and involvement in the radical politics of the 1930s- he was blacklisted in the 1950s- puts into context the seemingly irreconcilable skepticism and optimism that contoured this lyrical genius's life and work.<br>Harold Meyerson is Executive Editor and chief political columnist, <i>L.A. Weekly</i>, and is on the editorial board of <i>Dissent</i>. Ernie Harburg is a social psychologist and epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, coauthor (with Bernard Rosenberg) of <i>The Broadway Musical: Collaboration in Commerce and Art</i>, and Yip Harburg's son. <br></p><p>&#39;Yip Harburg was the greatest lyric writer of them all, and this is a wonderful book. I&#39;ve learned more about songwriting and how songs are written, the really good songs, from this one book than from any other.&#39;--Tony Bennett, singer"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?," "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," "How Are Things in Glocca Morra?" and "April in Paris" are some of the most beloved songs of the American musical theater. Their lyricist, Yip Harburg, was, like so many of his peers, the son of Jewish immigrants, Russian in his case, who settled on the lower-east side of Manhattan. Inspired by the theater at an early age, he did not begin his career until he was in his thirties and had spent a stint managing the family business--an experience he detested. One of the songsmiths who changed the American musical from the revue format into a so-called book show in which song and dance became media for telling a dramatic story, Harburg's most famous collaborators were Harold Arlen, his partner in 111 efforts including <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, and Barton Lane, with whom his most famous product was <i>Finian's Rainbow</i>. This biography benefits from the collaboration of Harburg's son Ernie; plenty of pictures; appendixes of Harburg's stage, film, and broadcast credits; a list of his song titles; and lots of quoted lyrics. <i>Edward Lighthart</i></p><h2>Defiant Ecstasy</h2><p>Beautiful Alisha Williams, living on the frontier at Fort Pierre and scorned by the other settlers because she had loved an Oglala warrior, desperately waits for her lover, Grey Eagle, to return and rescue her from her misery.

Visit her online at www.martaperry.com.<p>Years ago there had been no bridge to the island, and it had slept in haunted isolation. Now two lanes of concrete spanned the sound, carrying Sarah Wainwright quickly from the Georgia coast to St. James Island. Too quickly. She wasn't ready.</p> <p>Perspiration slickened her hands against the steering wheel. She couldn't stop, couldn't pull off, couldn't turn around. The bridge funneled her inexorably to the one place in the world she didn't want to be. The entire past year hadn't been enough time to prepare herself for what awaited her on St. James.</p> <p>The island appeared, a green, insubstantial smudge against a clear May sky, and Sarah's stomach lurched. St. James&nbsp;&#x2014; home to an uneasy, volatile mixture of local Gullah fishermen and the rich incomers who'd turned one end of the island into a private enclave for the wealthy and powerful. </p> <p>St. James had been Sarah's home, too, for six short months. Then betrayal and tragedy sent her fleeing back to her native Boston.</p> <p>Fleeing unsuccessfully. She'd discovered, since the anniversary of Miles's death in April, that she couldn't outrun grief. It hung, persistent, on her heels, hampering her every step, demanding her constant attention. Demanding that she face it here, on St. James. Her stomach gave another protesting spasm as the car wheels rolled off the bridge and onto the island.</p> <p>Live oaks, shrouded with Spanish moss, canopied the road. Sarah shivered in spite of the heat. Haunted.</p> <p><i>I don't believe in ghosts, Heavenly Father, but no other word fits.</i></p> <p>St. James was haunted by its own past, and now haunted by <i>her </i>past, too, and that of the husband who'd died here&nbsp;&#x2014; died in an apparent lovers' tryst with his employer's wife.</p> <p>The lobby of the St. James Inn was shuttered and cool, its only inhabitant the manager, leaning on his desk. Sarah caught the expression of shock mingled with avid curiosity that crossed his face at the sight of her, quickly replaced by his professional welcoming smile.</p> <p>"Dr. Wainwright. This is a pleasant surprise. We weren't expecting you." He glanced nervously at the desk computer and patted his thinning hair. "Were we?"</p> <p>"No, you weren't." She'd known instinctively it would be a mistake to announce her coming. </p> <p>She smiled, wishing she remembered the man's name. It would give her a fraction more leverage. Obviously he remembered hers. The island had probably talked of little else for months. </p> <p>"I'm sure you can find a room for me." The inn mainly housed overflow guests from the big houses, and they both knew May wasn't the high season.</p> <p>"Why...um..." He punched a few keys on his computer, clearly hoping for inspiration. Sarah knew exactly what he was thinking. What would Trent Donner want him to do?</p> <p>"Does&nbsp;&#x2014; does Mr. Donner know you're coming?"</p> <p>Nobody on St. James, conceivably nobody in Georgia, crossed Trent Donner with impunity. Sarah's stomach lurched again. Sooner or later she'd have to face him. Was she a coward for hoping it would be later? </p> <p>She managed a cool smile. "I thought I'd surprise him. I'll go out to Land's End tomorrow."</p> <p>Maybe it was the casual mention of the Donner estate. Something eased in the manager's face. "Why don't we give you the suite you had the last time you were here?"</p> <p><i>A lady never shows her feelings in public.</i></p> <p>Her grandmother's maxim, drilled into Sarah from birth, stiffened her spine and kept a smile frozen on her face. Knowing what he must, how could the man assume she'd want the suite she'd shared with Miles when they'd first arrived on the island? </p> <p>"That will be fine."</p> <p>She tried to put herself on autopilot to get through the next few minutes. Fill out the registration card, exchange comments about the weather. Follow the bellman, tip him, don't think about staying here with Miles when they'd first arrived on the island.</p> <p>Finally the door closed behind him, and she was alone in the quiet room with its cool white shutters, bamboo furniture and four-poster bed. Staying here was no worse than staying in any other room. No place on the island would be free of memories.</p> <p>That was why she'd fled, wasn't it? And that was why she'd come back. </p> <p>Her parents hadn't seemed surprised at Sarah's abrupt decision to return to the place of Miles's death. Duty loomed large in six generations of New England virtue, and they clearly felt Sarah had left duty unresolved, racing home the day after Miles's death, hiding from reporters, evading even her friends. </p> <p>But then, her parents had never believed Miles Wainwright could be guilty of betraying both his marriage and his employer by having an affair with his employer's wife. Or by dying with her. Not Miles Wainwright, descendant of his own six generations' worth of Puritan values.</p> <p>She hadn't believed it either, in spite of overwhelming evidence that Miles had, indeed, had an affair with Lynette Donner and died with her in a gas heater accident at the cottage where they'd met. She hadn't believed, couldn't believe, what Lynette's husband so obviously did. </p> <p>For weeks, maybe months, Sarah's mind had winced every time it came too close to the thought of Miles and Lynette together. If she didn't think about it, it didn't happen.</p> <p>Over time, the anguish and grief receded to a dull, hollow ache, only flaring painfully when unexpectedly jostled, like a deep wound beginning to skin over with tender, fragile flesh. Work had helped. She'd taken on emergency room duty at the hospital, grateful for the killing schedule that let her fall into bed, exhausted enough to sleep, every night.</p> <p>Eventually she could actually look at the possibility of Miles's betrayal for more than a moment at a time. Look at it, assess it, bring reason to bear. </p> <p>And find that she still, more than a year after the fact, didn't believe it. Miles&nbsp;&#x2014; loyal, upright Miles&nbsp;&#x2014; was not a man who'd betray his marriage and his employer. He <i>wasn't.</i></p> <p>To the weight of her faith in Miles, Sarah added faith in her own perceptions. <i>I couldn't not have known that Miles was deceiving me, could I, Lord?</i> If her perceptions were that skewed, the earth was no longer solid under her feet.</p> <p>So she'd come back to St. James. Everyone&nbsp;&#x2014; Lynette's husband, the police, the coroner&nbsp;&#x2014; everyone was wrong. Whatever Miles had been doing at Cat Isle that day with Lynette, he wasn't having an affair. Somewhere on St. James there were answers, and this time she wouldn't run away. This time she wouldn't leave until she found them.</p> <p>A knock shattered the stillness. The manager, having forgotten something in his nervous haste? She smoothed her linen slacks, wrinkled from travel, and opened the door. And confronted Trent Donner, filling the doorway with well over six feet of fury, all of it radiating directly at her.</p> <p>"What are you doing here?" He surged inside on the words. Sarah stumbled back a step or two, heart hammering against her ribs. Trying to keep him out would be as futile as trying to stop the tide.</p> <p>"The manager called you," she stated flatly.</p> <p>She should have known he would do that. She should have been prepared, instead of standing here with her mouth dry from shock. She'd forgotten the aura of power Trent brought with him into a room, as if everyone and everything rotated around him.</p> <p>"Of course." Trent dismissed the man with a negligent gesture.</p> <p>Sarah found her temper at the unconscious arrogance of the man. Good. One always needed an edge in dealing with Trent Donner, and anger seemed to be the only edge she had.</p> <p>"Why shouldn't I be here?" Answer a question with a question. Catch your breath. Slow your pounding heart. </p> <p>"I'd think that would be obvious." Trent's voice was hard, incisive, with an edge of mockery. He took a swift step forward, and the afternoon sun crossed his face, lighting the harsh angles of cheekbone and jaw. </p> <p>Sarah drew in a breath. The last time she'd seen him, it had been across two motionless bodies and the wreckage of too many lives. His normally impassive face had been etched with pain, grief and a kind of hopeless rage. </p> <p>Now the lines seemed permanently engraved, turning the strong planes of his face into a marble mask. Only his clear gray eyes were alive, blazing with feeling. With fury. Her heart jolted, sickeningly. She was trapped by his presence.</p> <p>"I didn't..."</p> <p>Sarah heard a faint waver in her voice, stopped and swallowed. She could face drug overdoses and multiple fatalities in the E.R. She could face him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry if my being here upsets you, but I do have ties here." She forced herself to meet his fierce gaze calmly. "My husband died here."</p> <p>"I hardly need a reminder of that." His voice, normally deep, roughened and deepened still further. Shared pain flicked past the anger Sarah held like a shield, catching her on the raw. </p> <p>That elemental pain must be the only thing they shared. She wanted, suddenly, to comfort him, and knew in the same instant that she was the one person who never could.</p> <p>Perhaps he saw her wince, perhaps he only heard the revelation in his own voice. He paused, another feeling quarreling with the anger. </p> <p>"I'm sorry." He brushed a strand of black hair from his forehead with a swift, economical movement, and she saw that his hair was touched now with white at both temples. The year had aged him, as it had her. "I've never had much in the way of manners." His mouth twitched in what might have been a smile. "I'm forgetting myself. How are you, Sarah?"</p> <p>The reluctant concern in his voice disarmed her, touching something that seemed to reverberate to the timbre of his voice.</p> <p>"I'm...all right. I went back to work. That helped."</p> <p>"At Boston General?"</p> <p>She nodded, vaguely surprised that he remembered the name of the hospital where she'd interned before she'd moved south and married Miles. But Trent had always had an encyclopedic memory, as well as an unerring ability to rearrange odd pieces in unexpected ways. That gift that had fascinated Miles's more prosaic intelligence. </p> <p>"How is Melissa?" His daughter would be twelve now, a crucial age for a girl. How had she coped with the tragedy?</p> <p>Trent's face tightened, if marble conceivably could. He'd never looked his nearly forty years, until bitterness and grief etched their mark on him. "She's all right." </p> <p>The shortness of his answer told Sarah Melissa was not all right, and fresh pain gripped her heart. Poor child. She'd had problems enough before tragedy had shattered all their worlds.</p> <p>Well, little though she'd wanted to see Trent today, he'd given her the opportunity to get on with what she had to do. "I'd like to see her..."</p> <p>"No!" Trent's eyes blazed, and her heart lurched into over-drive. She'd always felt something wild lurked under that expensively tailored gray business suit, and now it seemed about to surface. </p> <p>"Trent, just hear me out." What could she say that would make him listen?</p> <p>"I don't want you anywhere near my daughter." A muscle twitched at the corner of his mouth and was ruthlessly stilled.</p> <p>"I don't want you anywhere on St. James at all."</p> <p>The momentary truce was over, the brief span of shared emotion banished. Sarah stopped attempting to control her anger. When Trent had been Miles's employer, she'd had to be polite to him. That constraint didn't exist anymore. </p> <p>"Or anywhere in Georgia? I'm not sure my whereabouts is your concern."</p> <p>"It is when it affects me. When it affects my daughter." The words shot at her like bullets. His hands knotted into fists and then unwound with what appeared a superhuman effort.</p> <p>"Don't you think I'm affected by being here?" Hurt edged her voice. "I had to come."</p> <p>He shook his head, as if to clear it. "I know you're as much a victim of what happened as we are." He clearly tried hard for a reasonable tone. "I'm sorry for you. But your being here will only stir up things that are better left buried."</p> <p>"Better for whom? Not better for me!" If only she could make him see. "Don't you understand? I've spent a year trying to bury the past. It can't be done. I can't leave it alone until I know what really happened."</p> <p>For the space of a heartbeat the words hung in silence between them. Then Trent made a sudden, violent motion that sent Sarah back a step.</p> <p>"Is that what this is all about?" His hands shot out to grasp her wrists, and he looked as if he'd rather have them around her throat. "You want to dig it all up again, make us relive it. For what? So you can satisfy that strict Puritan conscience of yours? That's it, isn't it? You have to prove to yourself that you're not to blame."</p> <p>"No!" Sarah felt her pulse pound against the warm hard grip of his hands. He was too close. She was suffocating, as if his pain and anger drew all the air out of the room. "This isn't for me. This is for Miles. I don't believe it. I've tried, and I can't believe it."</p> <p>"Try harder." Eyes blazing, he thrust his hard face toward her. "It happened."</p> <p>Sarah had a sudden vivid image of a wolf, eyes gleaming, closing on its prey. People said Trent Donner never forgot and never forgave. She could believe it.</p></p><h2>Succulents and Cactus (Sunset Gardening Books)</h2><p>One of Sunsets great gardening books, it contains lots of information about growing them and about individual plants.</p><p></p><h2>The Second Amendment Primer: A Citizen&#39;s Guidebook to the History, Sources, and Authorities for the Constitutional Guarantee of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms</h2><p>So much of the debate about the Second Amendment is in scholarly journals and academic papers written by scholars and judges, or directed towards other scholars, law professors, attorneys, and judges.

Robert Thurman is one such teacher. Now, in his first experiential course on the essentials of Tibetan Buddhism, adapted and expanded from a popular retreat he led, Thurman -- the first Westerner ordained by His Holiness the Dalai Lama himself -- shares the centuries-old wisdom of a highly valued method used by the great Tibetan masters. Using a revered, once-secret text of a seventeenth-century Tibetan master, along with a thorough explanation for contemporary Westerners, <i>The Jewel Tree of Tibet</i> immerses you fully in the mysteries of Tibetan spiritual wisdom. A retreat in book form as well as a spiritual and philosophical teaching, it offers a practical system of understanding yourself and the world, of developing your learning and thought processes, and of gaining deep, transforming insight. <br> Tibetans think of their cherished tradition of Buddhism as a "wish-fulfilling jewel tree" for its power to generate bliss and enlightenment within all who absorb its teachings. Happiness, in fact, is the true goal of Tibetan spirituality, and the wish-fulfilling jewel tree will put you on the road to that reachable goal. This beautiful jewel-tree imagery, which acts like a mandala or a yoga pose to focus your attention on truths larger than yourself, will help you break through worn-out ideas and habits, strengthen positive abilities, develop more energy and creativity, and change your life -- and future -- for the better. As Thurman writes, "Readers learn to cultivate the sensitivity and appreciation to love more fully, feel compassion more intensely, and become a fountain of cheerfulness for all they meet and know." <br> Because the path to enlightenment requires more than sitting in meditation, <i>The Jewel Tree of Tibet</i> offers a rich, intellectually riveting course with many specific spiritual practices, including: eleven steps to create the spirit of enlightenment, here and now; the truths and stories of the ancient Indian and Tibetan sages; and guided meditations to experience the blessings of the wish-fulfilling jewel tree. You can do these practices with others or on your own, while living your daily life. And as you travel this road to deeper self-realization, self-understanding, and infectious happiness, you will also learn how the principles of Tibetan Tantra can open the doors to "infinite compassion and continuity," and how to discover states of consciousness that transcend even death. <br> One of the most explicit teachings of the steps to the path of enlightenment available, explained by a skilled Western teacher, <i>The Jewel Tree of Tibet</i> will enable you to honor the full subtlety and hidden depths of the Tibetan Buddhist path and realize at last its deeper mysteries and rewards -- for yourself and others.</p><p>Robert Thurman is probably best know for his translation of the sacred text <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, although he has published many works of both translation and exploration of Tibetan Buddhism. <i>The Jewel Tree of Tibet</i> is a significant addition to Thurman&#x2019;s contribution to this field of spiritual scholarship. His deep knowledge and devotion are in evidence on every page. His style is straightforward and inviting. He also provides a short introduction to the history of Buddhism which is as clear and straightforward as possible for what can be an exceptionally complex and entangled topic. <p> In short, Thurman writes for real people with an interest in (perhaps longing for) a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world. In addition to a clear and inviting style and providing the reader with an accessible understanding of important spiritual matters, this book is exceptionally openhanded and openhearted. While Thurman wants us to share the dharma of the Jewel Tree he also wants the reader to know that they are already on their path- no matter what their faith or non-faith, political beliefs, no matter what manner of thinking may appear to divide, separate, or individualize us: Thurman presents a view of the self in which we can see that it is possible to overcome these limitations and alienations and to see ourselves as inhabiting common ground with the suffering, the joy, and the seeking of others. His bias is ecumenical in the best and most generous sense of the word. </p><p> This is an excellent book for the person just awakening to their spiritual path and for the seeker of many years.--<i>Julian Riepe</i></p>One of the leading Western scholars on Tibet and Tibetan religion, Thurman introduces listeners to the basic teachings of Tibetan Buddhism in the form of a six-part, guided retreat.

The Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints is an an extremely powerful and influential religious organization, reaching hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, what the Mormons are propagating is a false god, false Jesus, and false gospel. This incisive book clearly explains the Mormons&#39; basic beliefs and sharply refutes their subtle heresies. After walking the reader through the Mormons&#39; evangelistic techniques and strategies, the book gives Christians easy-to-use guidance on witnessing to Mormons, so they can effectively and lovingly defend the true Christian faith.</p><p></p><h2>The Pillars of Hercules : A Grand Tour of the Mediterranean</h2><p>At the gateway to the Mediterranean lie the two Pillars of Hercules: Gibraltar and Ceuta, in Morocco. Paul Theroux decided to travel from one to the other - but taking the long way round. His grand tour of the Mediterranean begins in Gibraltar and takes him through Spain, the French Riviera, Italy, Greece, Istanbul and beyond. He travels by any means necessary - including dilapidated taxi, smoke-filled bus, bicycle and even a cruise-liner. And he encounters bullfights, bazaars and British tourists, discovers pockets of humanity in war-torn Slovenia and Croatia, is astounded by the urban developments on the Costa del Sol and marvels at the ancient wonders of Delphi. Told with Theroux&#39;s inimitable wit and style, this lively and eventful tour evokes the essence of Mediterranean life.</p><p>Paul Theroux has developed one of travel writing&#39;s most identifiable styles: always the foreigner, always a bit apart, slightly irascible, but perfectly observant. At last he has ventured to one of the most traveled places on earth, and returned with his most exhilarating, revealing, and eloquent travel book. In this modern version of the Grand Tour, Theroux sets off from Gibraltar, one of the fabled Pillars of Hercules, on a glorious journey around the shores of the Mediterranean."DAZZLING."<br>--Time<br>"[THEROUX'S] WORK IS DISTINGUISHED BY A SPLENDID EYE FOR DETAIL AND THE TELLING GESTURE; a storyteller's sense of pacing and gift for granting closure to the most subtle progression of events; and the graceful use of language. . . .

Brothers Edward and Lincoln Filene were revolutionaries who championed employee relations and innovative merchandising. In 1909, Edward organized and opened Filene&#39;s famous Automatic Bargain Basement. Lincoln helped found the Federated Department Stores Company in March 1929. Filene&#39;s was a pioneer in branch-store development. In its heyday, the store hosted appearances by fashion designers, such as Christian Dior, Pierre Cardin, and Pauline Trig�re, in addition to celebrities, like Zsa Zsa Gabor, Gloria Swanson, and Gene Autry. A victim of retail consolidation, the flagship downtown Boston store closed its doors in 2006. Its building, designed by the internationally renowned architect Daniel Burnham, celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2012 and anxiously awaits its redevelopment. Most of these historic photographs come directly from the Filene Marketing Archives at the Boston Public Library.</p><p>Author Michael J. Lisicky is a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music and serves as an oboist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. He lectures and has written extensively on various department store histories."Employees close the door to Filene's at the Cape Cod Mall for the last time on March 26, 2006. PAUL BLACKMORE/Cape Cod Filene's lighthouse-style building in the "Queen's Buyway" mall and its downtown Hyannis store began as seasonal shops for Bostonians who needed to pick up a few things while summering on the Cape.<br>"Filene's in Hyannis and Falmouth were like traveling trunk shows ... They wanted to stress these were the same prices you'd get in Boston. Both stores were predominantly 'a ladies' shop' but Hyannis was special because it had a children's shoe shop," says Michael J. Lisicky, an oboist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. How is it that a professional musician knows so much about the minute details of Filene's? While music is his vocation, department store history is a passionate avocation that has led Lisicky to pen books about Hutzler's, Wanamaker's, Gimbels and, most recently, "Filene's: Boston's Great Specialty Store" (Arcadia Publishing, $21.95).<br>"It's not a coincidence that my 12-year-old daughter's name is Jordan," says Lisicky, noting that department store giant, Jordan Marsh, was often paired with Filene's. (He dedicates the Filene's book to her, noting that she's lucky her parents didn't make her middle name Marsha as they considered.)<br>"Filene's was a ready-to-wear store at a time when people were making their own clothes at home. They were a specialty store, not a department store. They didn't have housewares, furniture or appliances. For that, you went to Jordan Marsh."<br>Although Filene's closed in 2006, this year marks the 100th anniversary of its flagship building in downtown Boston, designed by the internationally renowned architect Daniel Burnham, Lisicky writes, noting that the building "anxiously awaits its redevelopment."<br>With more than 200 old photos and advertisements from the Filene's Marketing Archives at the Boston Public Library, as well as reams of research, Lisicky tells the story of a Jewish immigrant, William Filene, who opened a dry goods store in 1851 that would grow, through the generations, into a retail empire.<br>"Thank goodness, somebody had the forethought not to throw out these photos and advertisements," says Lisicky, whose book includes a 1978 Filene's Basement flier explaining the automatic price reduction system and a puzzle that was part of a circa 1970 coloring contest at the Hyannis Filene's.<br>In addition to providing the Cape's first specialty store in 1920, the second-generation Filene brothers were neighbors on the peninsula.<br>"William's sons, (Abraham) Lincoln and Edward Filene, shared a summer home on the Cape. It was their Hyannisport," Lisicky says in an interview from his Maryland home. "Lincoln Filene passed away at the place in Marstons Mills in 1957 and is buried there."<br>The book's foreword is written by Lincoln Filene Ladd, an octogenarian who is a grandson of Lincoln Filene.<br>The bulk of Lisicky's book focuses on Filene's flagship store and how the Filene brothers changed the retail industry by stressing employee relations and benefits, as well as pairing fashion and entertainment. The flagship store had a restaurant with no tipping allowed.<br>"In its heyday, the store hosted appearances by fashion designers, such as Christian Dior, Pierre Cardin, and Pauline Trig�re, in addition to celebrities, like Zsa Zsa Gabor, Gloria Swanson, and Gene Autry, Lisicky writes.<br>But the Filene brothers were also known for their adeptness at opening branch stores, including one in Falmouth in 1920, Providence in 1922 and Hyannis in 1923.<br>"The store on Queen's Buyway went year-round at Christmas 1940. They had to winterize (the circa 1925 Cape Cod building). With soldiers coming to Camp Edwards (the East Coast's largest World War II mobilization base), there were such limited shopping availabilities," Lisicky says.<br>Post-war, the Falmouth Filene's closed in 1947 and business transferred to the Hyannis store, which had opened year-round in 1943 and remained open until Filene's moved to Cape Cod Mall when it opened in 1970.<br>"The Cape Cod Mall said it opened in 1971, but it actually opened June 15, 1970," Lisicky says. "I get anal about details because I would like people to be able to use this book as a historical reference."<br>In 2005, Filene's closed at the mall, leaving only the Filene's Basement store across the way on Route 132. That closed in 2009.<br>Lisicky says he was surprised at the strong affection and loyalty people still express for the defunct Filene's stores.<br>"These places stuck with you. They encouraged family and good benefits for workers," he says. "The store closed March 1, 2005, and the Filene's faithful wax nostalgic, mourning tradition, talking about going to Boston twice a year to shop. Older people especially liked Filene's because they grew up with it.""<br>Cape Cod Times, Gwenn Friss</p><h2>Biblical Revelation, the Foundation of Christian Theology,</h2><p>Book is clean with possible wear on cover and spine</p><p></p><h2>Roses Are Pink, Your Feet Really Stink (Gilbert the Opossum)</h2><p>When Gilbert writes two not-so-nice valentines to his classmates, his prank quickly turns into pandemonium.

In this book, Mark invites readers to explore their own inner core through the stories of ordinary people, political activists, artists, spiritual teachers from a variety of traditions. These are people who have faced themselves, their warts and weaknesses. They have stood by the courage of their convictions in all kinds of moments, great and small. Nepo&#39;s insights and commentary are spot on, and help readers relate the stories of others to their own lives. The book is divided into three sections--finding our inner core, standing by our inner core, and sustaining the practice of living from that place. Each of the nearly 60 brief essays and stories elucidates and inspires. Nepo&#39;s broad range of stories and people, of traditions and insights, offers myriad ways for readers to relate to their own search for courage.

Jess calls back, motioning frantically to Emma and me. </p><p> Giggling, the two of us scoop up the evidence -- garlic powder, cinnamon, peppermint extract, and blue food coloring -- and hastily stuff it back into the spice cupboard. </p><p> "Doesn't sound like nothing to me." We hear Mrs. Delaney's chair scrape on the dining room floor as she pushes back from the table and comes to the kitchen to investigate. </p><p> Emma and I quickly wipe the grins off our faces. Jess leans back casually against the counter, blocking our concoction from view. </p><p> "Hmmm," says Mrs. Delaney, scanning the kitchen suspiciously. She spots the open spice cupboard and lifts an eyebrow. </p><p> "Uh, we were thinking of baking cookies," Jess explains, which isn't technically a lie even though we decided not to because the kitchen is sweltering. </p><p> Normally, any of our mothers would have seen through this in a flash, but Mrs. Delaney seems kind of distracted today. She shakes her head and sighs. "Please don't bake anything, girls, it's hot enough in here already without turning the oven on. We've got peppermint ice cream -- you can have some of that if you want a snack." She opens the freezer and sticks her head inside. "A day like today kind of makes you wish it was winter, doesn't it?" </p><p> "Or that we had air conditioning," says Jess mournfully. </p><p> Mrs. Delaney pulls her head out again and gives her a sympathetic smile. "Maybe someday, honey. Right now we have other priorities." She looks over at Emma. The smile disappears. "Emma Hawthorne, you must be roasting in that turtleneck! Didn't you offer her a T-shirt, Jess?" </p><p> Jess looks uncomfortable. "Uh -- " </p><p> "I forgot to bring something to change into after school, and nothing of Jess's fits me, Mrs. Delaney," Emma replies matter-of-factly, patting her stomach. Emma is a little on the plump side, and Jess is really petite. </p><p> "Well for Pete's sake, you should have said something," Mrs. Delaney tells her. "We have plenty of things around here that will work for you. Hang on a sec." </p><p> She trots upstairs. As soon as her mother is out of sight, Jess grabs the jar of blue liquid from the counter behind her and sticks it in her T-shirt pocket. I glance over at Emma. Emma is one of my best friends, but she's not exactly the fashion queen of Concord, Massachusetts. I mean, I like to dress up for the first day of school too, but a turtleneck on a day like this? You'd think she'd know by now that the beginning of September is pretty much still summer everywhere, except maybe Alaska. At least she picked a good color. Purple goes well with her brown eyes and curly brown hair. And it matches her new lavender glasses, too. </p><p> Mrs. Delaney reappears and tosses Emma a white T-shirt with a <i>HeartBeats</i> logo on it. "Try this," she says. </p><p> <i>HeartBeats</i> is the soap opera that Mrs. Delaney was on last year. You'd never guess by looking at her now that she's an actress. When we visited her in New York this past summer, she was all glamorous. Now -- well, now she looks the way she always did. Today, for instance, she's wearing jeans and a faded Red Sox T-shirt. She's still pretty and everything -- really pretty, just like Jess, with the same sparkly blue eyes, though Mrs. Delaney's hair is dark, not blond like Jess's -- but she looks ordinary, too. Like a mom. I wonder if she misses all the makeup and clothes and stuff from her acting job. I sure would. But Mrs. Delaney seems really happy to be back home at Half Moon Farm. </p><p> "How's your mom doing, Megan?" she asks me. "We missed her yesterday at yoga class." </p><p> "She just got elected to the board of the Concord Riverkeepers," I tell her. "Yesterday was their first meeting." My mother's kind of a nature freak. If something on the planet needs saving or protecting, you can bet Lily Wong is there on the front lines to make sure it gets done. </p><p> "Oh, that's right, she told us about that," Mrs. Delaney replies. "I guess I forgot." She spots the pile of mail on the counter where Jess left it. "Bills, bills, nothing but bills," she grumbles, flipping through the envelopes. Shaking her head, she disappears back into the dining room. </p><p> Jess gets three bowls from the cupboard and dishes up some ice cream for us. Crossing the kitchen, she beckons Emma and me to follow. One of her chickens -- Johnny Cash or Elvis or something, I can't keep their names straight -- darts in the minute she opens the screen door. Jess nabs it and it lets out a big squawk. </p><p> "You know the rules, Loretta," Jess tells it firmly. "No chickens in the house!" </p><p> Sometimes I still can't believe I'm friends with somebody who talks to chickens. Or somebody who even <i>has</i> chickens. </p><p> Emma and I follow Jess to the barn. Mr. Delaney let us fix up an old storage room in the hayloft for a secret hangout. Not that it's much of a secret, what with Jess's little brothers always sneaking around. </p><p> Right now, there's no sign of them. We scared them off after we caught them spying on us in Jess's room when we were changing out of our school clothes. They'll turn up eventually, though -- they always turn up -- and when they do we'll be ready for them, thanks to the concoction that's safely in Jess's pocket. </p><p> "I wish it could stay summer forever," sighs Emma, climbing up the hayloft ladder behind me. </p><p> "Me too," echoes Jess. </p><p> <i>Not me,</i> I think, but I don't say anything. I've always liked the first day of school. Mostly because I get to wear one of the new outfits that I spend all summer picking out. I can't help it -- I like clothes. I want to be a fashion designer when I grow up. </p><p> "Hey, did you guys see Zach Norton at assembly this morning?" I ask them. "He's so tall! He must have grown about a foot over the summer." I take a bite of ice cream and give Emma a sidelong glance. "He's cuter than ever too." </p><p> Emma shrugs, but her cheeks turn as pink as her ice cream. Lately she's been telling us that she doesn't have a crush on Zach anymore. Jess and Cassidy and I are pretty sure she still does, though. Not that I'd mind if she didn't -- the way I see it, the fewer girls lined up hoping Zach Norton will notice them, the better my chances are. </p><p> The fact that we both like Zach is one of the only things Emma and I have in common, when you come right down to it. Well, that and the mother-daughter book club our moms cooked up last year. We look different, for starters. I'm Asian American -- Emma's not. She's a bookworm -- I'm not. I love fashion and clothes -- she could care less. And although she's not off-the-charts smart like Jess, she's a good student. Me, I just scrape by, which drives my parents nuts. Somehow, despite our differences we're still good friends. </p><p> Emma sticks out her lower lip and puffs at her bangs, which are sticking to her forehead. It's even hotter out here in the barn than it was in the Delaneys' kitchen. Jess turns on the table fan and aims it straight at the old sofa where the three of us are sitting. </p><p> "Can you believe we're in seventh grade now?" she says. "Just think -- two more years and we'll be in high school." </p><p> We eat our ice cream for a while as we think this over. </p><p> "We're going to be <i>teenagers</i> this year," Emma adds. "We're practically grown-ups!" </p><p> Sometimes I feel like I've been looking forward to being a teenager forever. I can't wait until I'm old enough to drive. And have a summer job. And I especially can't wait until I'm old enough to date. </p><p> "So do either of you have any classes with Zach this year?" I ask, trying to sound casual. </p><p> "Zach! Zach! Ooooo, Zach Norton!" squeal a pair of voices behind us. </p><p> We whirl around to see Dylan and Ryan, Jess's twin brothers, emerge from under a pile of old horse blankets in the corner. </p><p> "I TOLD YOU TO QUIT SPYING ON US!" hollers Jess. </p><p> She launches off the sofa toward them, but they're too fast for her. Shrieking in alarm, they duck past her out the door. The three of us are close on their heels. The boys fling themselves over the edge of the loft and tumble into the pile of hay below. Jess dives after them. So does Emma. I hesitate. My friends all love doing this, but it always seems like a long way down to me. </p><p> I close my eyes and force myself to jump. </p><p> "Ouch!" I cry when I land, wishing I were wearing jeans and not shorts. The hay is stiff and prickly, and it jabs into my bare legs. I scramble off of it as quickly as I can and run after Emma and Jess. </p><p> We corner her brothers by the chicken coop. </p><p> "Pest Control 101," Jess whispers to Emma and me, taking the small jar from her T-shirt pocket. "Watch and learn." She holds it up. The blue liquid inside shimmers in the September sunlight. "Gee," she says, "too bad you guys are such little weasels -- I was going to share some of this with you." </p><p> "What is it?" one of them asks cautiously. Like the chickens, I can't tell Dylan and Ryan apart. </p><p> Jess glances around, like maybe somebody is listening, and her voice drops to a whisper. "It's an <i>invisibility potion."</i> </p><p> Her brothers' eyes widen. </p><p> "Really?" says one of them. </p><p> Jess nods. "If you drink it, you'll disappear just like that." She snaps her fingers and looks over at Emma and me. "Isn't that right?" </p><p> Emma nods. "Yup. You'll vanish right into thin air." </p><p> "Vaporize," I tell them. </p><p> "Dematerialize," adds Jess for good measure. </p><p> The three of us are smothering grins. Emma's family invented this thing called the synonym game. I used to think it was dumb -- actually, I still do -- but it's kind of addictive. </p><p> "Please, can't we try it?" one of the twins begs. </p><p> "C'mon, Jess!" says the other. </p><p> Jess shakes her head. "No way. You broke your promise. You said you wouldn't spy on us anymore." </p><p> The boys exchange a glance. With their blond curls and brown puppy-dog eyes, they look like angels, but there's hardly anything angelic about them.
